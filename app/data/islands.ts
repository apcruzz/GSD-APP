`## SAMOA & AMERIKA SAMOA
**Greeting Word: Talofa**
**Current Population: 260,000**

__Samoa__ and __American Samoa__ – one people spread across two countries – are
located about 2,600 miles [4,180 km] southwest of Hawaii. The two major and
other smaller islands of Samoa include 1,130 square miles [2,930 km²] of land,
while about 77 square miles [199 km²] make up the five volcanic islands and
two atolls of American Samoa.

**Factoid:** The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, or Tusitala, who spent
his final years in Samoa and is buried there, dubbed the Samoans the “happy
people” because of their enjoyment of life and good spirited nature.


“**TALOFA!**” is the greeting word in Samoa.
Because Samoa is in the center of the Polynesian triangle, it is referred to as **“the Heart of Polynesia.”**
Geographically speaking, there are, in fact, two Samoas. **Samoa** is an independent country of about 1,130 square
miles and includes the islands of Savai'i and Upolu. The other, __American Samoa__, is a territory of 77 square miles
administered by the United States government and includes the eastern islands, primarily Tutuila. The
population of Samoa is just under __200,000__ and American Samoa has just under __60,000__ people. Jacob Roggeveen,
a Dutch Explorer, is credited with its discovery in 1722.

Although Samoa is two separate countries, its people, language and culture are one. From 1900 until the First
World War, Western Samoa was a German territory. After World War I, it became a trust territory administered
for the United Nations by New Zealand. In 1962, Western Samoa became the first independent Polynesian
nation.

The constitution of American Samoa defines the basic governmental and legal organization. It provides for
executive, legislative and judicial branches. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor head the executive branch
and the bicameral legislature is popularly elected.

Samoans are raised in villages, or **nu'u**, such as this one at the Polynesian Cultural Center. The courtyard found
in each village is called the **malae** and accommodates the traditional festivities and ceremonies of the village.
Each of the structures in a Samoan village serves a special purpose.

Buildings in Samoa are usually rounded in shape with domed roofs. Posts are spaced evenly around each
structure with large supporting beams in the center. The Samoans favor round shaped roofs not only for their
beauty and symmetry, but also for practical purposes. The round shape allows the rain to quickly run off to the
ground with out any obstructions. The dome shaped structure are also durable and up keep is minimal, but
most importantly they keep the interior cool and breezy during hot, humid days. Samoa’s location near the
equator means the weather is often hot and humid, which is why you will notice that none of the buildings have
walls.

The breeze comes in off the ocean and helps to
cool the occupants. Woven coconut leaf
blinds, called **pola**, are attached to the beams
of the buildings which can be lowered during
strong winds, storms, or when privacy is
desired. Roofing materials come from the
leaves of the sugar cane plant, some of which
are grown here in our plantation. The leaves
are bundled together and cleverly attached in
rows, round and around, until the whole roof
is covered. A first time thatch job will last 10-
15 years without repairs – in the absence of
excessively strong winds.

Image: Typical Samoan fale with pola lowered on the right to block wind or rain. Some pola in the raised position can also
be seen on the right of the building where the men of the village have gathered to meet.

## TUNOA or UMU KUKA: Kitchen
In Samoa the kitchen was the man’s domain because the preparation and cooking of food was
considered a physically demanding job. The Samoan earth oven is a typical hot rock oven, which is laid
out above the ground. The oven utilizes round river or lava rocks that conduct heat extremely well.
Four logs are arranged in a square with rocks, and then a fire is built to heat the rocks. When the fire
has heated the rocks and they are white with ash, charcoal debris is pushed aside and the food is placed
on the heated rocks. Fire resistant leaves are used to protect the food so they are not burnt. The whole
oven is then covered with banana leaves and other insulating materials.
Hunting, climbing coconut trees, husking, cracking and
milking the coconuts all required physical strength, and the
young men of the family show their respect to their parents,
grandparents, and women by performing these arduous
tasks. The young men prepare the food, and serve their
grandparents and parents first. Then the young children
eat. Finally, the cooks eat. This service is part of the Samoan
Way of Life, or __Fa’a Samoa__, in which respect is taught at a
young age. Young men serve their parents and elders in the
same way their future children will serve them when they
start their own families.

The coconut is one of the most important items in the life of
Samoans and other Polynesians. From the various parts of
the coconut tree materials for buildings, clothing, and food
preparation are obtained. The first step that must be done
to use the coconut is to climb the very high tree to get it.
Here in the Samoan village, you will be able to see how
skillful the young men are at climbing the coconut trees,
obtaining the coconuts, husking them and extracting its
inner flesh for cooking purposes.

Once husked using a very sharp stick, the actual nut itself appears to have a face on one end. Each
coconut appears to have two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. To crack open a coconut, a Samoan uses a
heavy object or stone and hits the line that runs across the face. The clear liquid inside the coconut is
the juice. Young coconuts that have not begun to produce much inner flesh contain more juice than ripe
coconuts. The coconut juice obtained from the very young coconuts is a refreshing drink in Samoa.
How do the Samoans get coconut milk? Inside
the coconut is the white meat that can be grated
and squeezed through a strainer made from
various wood fibers. The white liquid that falls
from the grated coconut is coconut milk and is
used in all types of Samoan cooking.
Other Samoan staple foods grown in the family
garden include sugarcane, bananas, taro,
tapioca, sweet potato, breadfruit, and the ava
plant. Meats include pork, chicken, fish, and
shellfish of all kinds.

## FALE NONOFO or FALE AFOLAU: Family Dwelling House
The Fale Nonofo is the family dwelling house. __Tapa__ is used to partition areas for sleeping. __Fala__, or mats
woven from the dried & softened leaves of the pandanus tree, are placed on the floor each night for
sleeping on, and rolled up and placed in the rafters each morning. The Fale Nonofo also serves as the
eating-place, where the food is served to the family, after being cooked at the tunoa.
As you observe the inside of this building, notice the cultural craftsmanship achieved by skilled workers
under the supervision of the master builder. The master builder is responsible not only for the physical
details, but also for the artistry of the building. A building of this size usually takes about 6 -8 weeks to
complete depending on the number of men working and their skill levels.
This particular structure also serves as a workshop in which men carve and women do arts and crafts.
You can try your hand at making fire by rubbing two sticks together as demonstrated by the young men
of Samoa.

## FALE TALIMALO: Guest House and FALE FONO: Meeting House (Same building; different purposes)
__Fale Talimalo__ means “a house to receive guests.” Not only pre-arranged guests are welcome to stay
here, but also a person or group passing by who needs a place to rest. When pre-arranged groups arrive,
the family (immediate or extended or the village) will prepare leis, food and special decorations. A
special welcome ceremony would be included if the guest is a high ranking chief.
When unexpected guests arrive, the immediate family will quickly prepare food and water. Bedding is
provided if the stay is extended. After the guests are fed and have rested, the chief will inquire as to the
purpose of the unexpected visit and the intended length of stay. He will then offer any further assistance
as needed.

When not being used to host visitors, this building is also used as the __Fale Fono__, meaning, “meeting
house.” As a __Fale Fono__, this building is to serve the chiefs of the village as a gathering place to discuss
the affairs of the village. The discussions include monitoring the performance of individual families, the
safety of all the villagers, each family beautifying their yards, planting food crops and raising meat
animals to encourage self-reliance and generally maintaining order in the village.
The posts surrounding the structure have special significance in Samoa. During meetings and
ceremonies, participants sit with their backs to a post representing their rank, family, or home village.
Some posts are reserved for various people of prestigious rank. The post centered at the left half of the
entrance is for the highest-ranking person in the visiting party, usually a chief. The post immediately
opposite is for the highest-ranking person of the home village, again usually a chief. The posts on either
side of the main entrance post are for the chief’s spokesmen known as the talking chiefs. The next two
posts on the left are for other local talking chiefs. Other minor participants sit on mats spread around
the outside rim. An interesting custom in Samoa is the fourth post from the left, known as the stranger’s
post. If a stranger comes into a meeting unannounced and demands it, the post must be surrendered to
him. From the three posts in the middle any food to be served during the meeting is dispensed.
The kava ceremony takes place in this building. Not only does it represent the highest form of welcome
to guests, it also represents a unity of purpose. The significance lies in each chief drinking from the
same coconut cup, representing a solemn commitment to ally himself with the consensus of the council.
It is a sign of loyalty and symbolizes the highest ideals of all participants and the village people they
represent.

The floor of this building is typical of what is found in Samoa. River pebbles and stones are gathered
from the nearby rivers and streams and spread to cover the interior area. The rocks help keep the house
cool and dry. If water does seep in, it spreads out under the rocks rather than pooling into hard-to-clean
puddles. Mats are placed on top of the rocks to provide comfort. The thicker the layer of mats, the softer
the seating area.

Fine mats, or __ie toga__, used for ceremonies in this building, require special weaving skills. The pandanus
leaves are cleaned, boiled, and bleached in the sun until the desired shade of whiteness is reached. The
leaves are then flattened and left to season for about a week. The weaver then takes a shell or possibly
the sharp, hard wing of a coconut beetle and cuts the leaves into fine strands for weaving. Some of the
mats are woven so fine that they have the appearance of expensive linen. After a mat is completed, it is
given a name and used as the traditional currency of Samoa. Mats are given as gifts at weddings,
funerals, the dedication of buildings, chiefly ceremonies, and other special occasions. It takes many
years of work to make an exceptionally fine mat.

## MAOTA O LE ALI’I or MAOTA TOFA: Chief’s House
__Matai__ is the Samoan word for leader or chief. There are two types of matai in Samoa - the __Ali’i__ and the
__Tulafale__. The Ali’i is the name of the highest title in a family. Those who hold an Ali’i title preside at
council meetings, oversee proceedings, make the final important decisions (after consulting with other
matai), and pass their instructions along in whispers to the High Talking Chiefs, or __Tulafale__, who are
the mouthpieces of the Ali’i. They are expected to be eloquent and skilled in the art of __lauga__ (oration).
The Tulafale represent the Ali’i as his spokesperson. The political system of Samoa was much more
open than in any other Polynesian group in the Pacific. Rather than being solely hereditary, it is possible
for people to rise to chiefly status by virtue of his or her abilities, loyalty to the village, and the service
one provides to the families in the village. The title of chief is conferred upon any eligible member of
the group, including women, with the common consent of the village and the chief’s council. The chiefs
are responsible for the general welfare of the group.

The __Maota Tofa__ is the Chief’s house. In Samoa, this building is usually elevated 5-8 feet signifying the
Chief’s prestige. A building of this size sometimes takes 3–4 months to build depending on the
manpower. The master builder, called the __Tufuga__, plans and instructs all workers of the measurements
of each beam and pole. He determines the fashion and the design of the sennit lashings, which hold all
joints in place. The way the beams are fastened together gives support to every 6--7 feet of the roof and
strengthens the roof against the strong winds and heavy rain. The large beams and the poles are cut
from the native trees of Samoa. The __ifilele__ (Iron wood), __koi__ (Mahogany), __niu__ (Coconut), __fau__ (Balsom).
There are three main reasons why a chief would have a building as large and beautiful as this. (1) The
chief is a well-respected individual by his family and the community and the building represents their
support and goodwill. (2) His title is of a royal line, or it is the highest in the family, village or district,
which he represents. (3) It represents the wealth of a strong family group or unified collection of villages.
The chief’s house was simply furnished. Because finely woven mats were exchanged as currency, the
more mats a chief possessed and displayed, the richer he was. They were important also as a method
of paying tribute at weddings, funerals, and other public events.
Only the chief would sleep on a bed, which is made of mats stacked to a desired height. Pillows were
made of bamboo and actually supported the head at the back of the neck. Samoans believe that sleeping
on a hard surface will give you a strong and straight posture.

Some of the implements utilized by the chief:
o __TO’OTO’O__ (or Staff). It symbolizes the authority to speak.
o __FUE__ (or swish). It symbolizes the power of speech.
o __ULA FALA__ (or pandanus seed lei). It symbolizes one who has been given an ordained title.
o __TANOA FAI AVA__ (ava bowl). The chiefs perform a ritual ceremony of the ava in which a
special drink is mixed in this bowl. It symbolizes peace, brotherhood and unity.
o __TAO__ (or spear). It represents each chief as a warrior and shows that he is prepared and ready
to fight for his family, his freedom and his village.
War clubs were favored in tribal wars because Samoans preferred hand-to-hand combat. Throwing
weapons was disdained because it was considered cowardly. The clubs displayed here are carved from
Hawaiian wood. Notice that the club heads are patterned after things found in nature like the pineapple
and the sea urchin. Today, war clubs are finished with a coat of varnish or lacquer to preserve it and
give it a shiny finish. Traditionally, they were rubbed with a cowry shell for a special gloss.

## TATAU: The Art of Tatooing
Samoans have been practicing the art of tattooing for over 2000 years. Two Fijian women, __Taema__ and
__Tifaiga__, introduced the practice of tattooing to Samoa. Today, Samoan males desiring chiefly status or
leadership roles are generally tattooed. Many other men acquire tattoos for their appeal as a mark of
adulthood, a symbol of cultural identity, a revival of an ancient craft, and an acceptable body decoration
of beauty.

Before the arrival of missionaries, it was compulsory for all males to be tattooed. It was considered a
decorative art form, which visibly denoted rank and status. Young men were tattooed between the ages
of 14 and 18 when they had stopped growing so that the intricate designs would not stretch. Tattooing
extended from the hips down to the knees. Although there has been a revival of tattooing, it still does
not equal its former acceptance.
Tattooing is a painful process. The Samoan tattoo master creates the designs with a comb-like tattoo
instrument. The larger the comb, the greater the area on the skin is covered with fewer strokes. He
punctures the skin by tapping the instrument with a small mallet.
Samoan women were also tattooed, but usually in lesser quantity.

      history: 'Samoa has been inhabited for over 3,000 years, referred to as "the Heart of Polynesia" because it sits in the center of the Polynesian Triangle. The Samoan islands were first settled by Lapita people around 1500 BCE. Geographically, there are two Samoas: independent Samoa (about 1,130 square miles including Savai\'i and Upolu islands with nearly 200,000 people) and American Samoa (77 square miles including Tutuila with under 60,000 people). Dutch Explorer Jacob Roggeveen is credited with its discovery in 1722. From 1900 until WWI, Western Samoa was a German territory. After WWI, it became a trust territory administered by New Zealand for the UN. In 1962, Western Samoa became the first independent Polynesian nation. American Samoa has a constitution with executive, legislative and judicial branches. Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson (Tusitala) spent his final years in Samoa and dubbed Samoans the "happy people" because of their enjoyment of life.',
      culture: 'Samoan culture is built on the fa\'a Samoa, or "the Samoan way," which emphasizes community, family, and respect for elders taught from a young age. The matai (chief) system has two types: Ali\'i (highest title, presides at councils) and Tulafale (talking chiefs, eloquent spokespersons skilled in lauga/oration). Chiefs can be men or women, achieved by abilities and service rather than solely hereditary. Villages (nu\'u) have courtyards called malae for ceremonies. Buildings are rounded with domed roofs that allow rain to run off quickly, keep interiors cool during hot humid weather, and are durable with minimal upkeep. Posts are spaced evenly with large center beams. No walls allow ocean breezes through. Woven coconut leaf blinds (pola) can be lowered for storms or privacy. Sugar cane leaf roofing lasts 10-15 years. River pebbles cover floors to keep houses cool and dry. The master builder (Tufuga) oversees construction using native woods: ifilele (ironwood), koi (mahogany), niu (coconut), fau (balsom). Traditional arts include siapo (bark cloth), tatau (tattooing for over 2000 years), and siva (dance).',
      traditions: 'The \'ava (kava) ceremony in the fale fono represents the highest form of welcome and unity of purpose. Chiefs drink from the same coconut cup (tanoa fai ava) showing commitment to consensus - a sign of loyalty symbolizing highest ideals. The ceremony uses special implements: to\'oto\'o (staff symbolizing authority to speak), fue (swish symbolizing power of speech), ula fala (pandanus seed lei for ordained titles), and tao (spear showing readiness to fight for family and village). Traditional tattooing (tatau) was introduced by two Fijian women, Taema and Tifaiga. Before missionaries arrived, all males were tattooed between ages 14-18 from hips to knees using comb-like instruments tapped with mallets - a painful process marking rank, status, adulthood, and cultural identity. Women were also tattooed but less extensively. The tunoa/umu kuka (kitchen) is the man\'s domain for physically demanding food preparation. Young men climb coconut trees, husk coconuts (which have faces with two eyes, nose, mouth), crack them, extract flesh, and make coconut milk by grating and straining the meat. They serve grandparents and parents first, then children, finally themselves - showing respect in fa\'a Samoa. War clubs were favored over throwing weapons (considered cowardly). Clubs are carved from Hawaiian wood, patterned after nature (pineapple, sea urchin), traditionally rubbed with cowry shells for gloss.',
      language: 'Samoan (Gagana Samoa) is a Polynesian language spoken by over 500,000 people. Common phrases: Talofa (hello), Fa\'afetai (thank you), Tofa (goodbye). Buildings have specific names: tunoa/umu kuka (kitchen using hot rock oven above ground with river/lava rocks), fale nofofo/fale afolau (family dwelling with tapa partitions and fala mats from pandanus leaves that are rolled up each morning, takes 6-8 weeks to build), fale talimalo (guest house receiving both pre-arranged and passing guests with food, water, bedding), fale fono (meeting house where posts represent rank - highest visiting chief sits at left entrance post, highest home chief at opposite post, talking chiefs at entrance side posts, fourth left post is the "stranger\'s post" that must be surrendered on demand, center posts dispense food), maota o le ali\'i/maota tofa (chief\'s house elevated 5-8 feet for prestige, takes 3-4 months to build, furnished with stacked mat beds, bamboo neck pillows for strong posture, displays ie toga/fine mats as currency showing wealth). Staple foods include sugarcane, bananas, taro, tapioca, sweet potato, breadfruit, ava plant, pork, chicken, fish, and shellfish.'

      overview:`Greeting Word: Kia ora
Current Population: 5.1 million

Aotearoa, located about 4,606 miles [7,412 km] from Hawaii, forms the
southwest apex of the Polynesian Triangle. The country covers approximately
103,000 square miles [268,000 km²] - about the size of Japan or the U.S. state of
Colorado – and consists of two major islands as well as several smaller island
groups. The four-season climate turns semi tropical in the north but includes
high snow covered mountains in the south.
AOTEAROA: NEW ZEALAND

“KIA ORA!” is the greeting word in New Zealand.
Legend tells us of the first explorer-navigator-discoverer of the islands. According to legend, Maui and his
brothers “fished up” the islands from the sea. The North Island is “The Fish of Maui” (a stingray). The South
Island is his canoe. Stewart Island is the anchor stone.
Later, in the 10th century, Kupe &
Ngake (Ngahue) ventured out
southwest from Tahiti, following the
traditional navigational instructions
left by the hero Maui so many years
earlier. The instructions were simple --
they were to keep their bearings
towards a certain set of stars in the sky.
In their canoe, carved by their own
hands, they ventured out into the
unknown and reached their
destination. From far off, Kupe’s wife
sighted land, and the gathering of white
clouds around one of the mountain
tops. She called out, “He ao! He ao!”
(A cloud! A cloud!). Thus was Aotearoa
discovered. It’s Maori name means,
“Long White Cloud” and is commonly
referred to as “The Land of the Long
White Cloud”.
Polynesians have been known to set sail
in search of new lands, their canoes
were provisioned with food and plants
for cultivation.
They remained isolated in New
Zealand until the arrival of European
explorers, the first of whom was the
Dutchman Abel Tasman (1642). During
that time, they grew in numbers to
between 100,000 and 200,000, living
almost exclusively on North Island.
They adopted the name Maori to
distinguish themselves from the
Europeans, who after the voyages of
the Englishmen Captain James Cook
(1769-1777), began to come in greater frequency. Individuals, families, and extended family groups continue
to acknowledge one another and are identified as descendants of specific tribal and sub-tribal ancestral leaders.
These tribal leaders can trace their genealogy to the original settlers who arrived in multiple waves of migration
aboard ocean-voyaging canoes.
It is situated in the South Pacific more than 1,000 miles southeast of Australia, its nearest neighbor. The country
is comprised of two main islands – the North and South islands – and a number of small islands, some of them
hundreds of miles from the main group. New Zealand is about 1,000 miles long and about 280 miles across at
its widest point. The land area is approximately 103,000 square miles – slightly smaller than the state of Colorado
and a little larger than the United Kingdom. The current population is 5.1 million, only about 17% of which are
native Maori., making them the largest group of Polynesians in the Pacific today.

New Zealand’s climate differs from one part of the country to another. The larger South Island is colder than
the North Island. Exceptionally bitter winds sweep the mountain summits of both islands and there is snow in
the higher altitudes. Unlike other Polynesian islands, New Zealand experiences four distinct seasons.
Within one to two days drive, one can see glaciers, fiords, snow-capped mountains, vast plains and hills, sub-
tropical forests, a volcanic plateau and white-sandy beaches. The spectacular scenery of both major islands has
been featured in the Hollywood films, “Lord of the Rings“ & “Hobbit“ trilogies, “Wolverine“, “The Last
Samurai“ and more. Aotearoa New Zealand is one of the youngest nations, with voyaging canoes bringing the
first settlers from other Polynesian islands, as late as the 12th century.
MARAE: The Courtyard
The mare is defined as a courtyard – the open area in front of a Maori meeting house and also refers to
the complex of other buildings surrounding it. Formal and informal interactions between people
continue to take place in such settings. They are associated with tribes and families and are located in
the historical tribal regions of these groups. All Maori connect to a marae through genealogy. It’s where
their parents, grandparents, or ancestors are from. Through generations of intermarriage, Maori are
able to connect to more than one marae.
The name of this particular marae is “Te Arohanui o Te Iwi Maori”, meaning, “The Great Love of the
Maori People”. The name honors the Polynesian Cultural Center’s founding Maori performing arts
group, “Te Arohanui Maori Company which came to Hawai’i in 1963 to assist in the final preparations
of the Polynesian Cultural Center’s opening in October of that year.
PUHARA: Watchtower
The watchtower or Puhara, was built to protect the village. Puhara were manned 24-hours per day. A
village was usually situated on top of a hill so that the extra height of the tower could allow a man to
see for miles on all sides. If strangers were approaching, the man in the watchtower would blow a large
wooden trumpet called the pukaea to warn the people in the village. A scout would then be sent to
ascertain whether the strangers came in peace or in war. Maori protocol calls for a ceremony-of-sorts
to be performed in these cases called powhiri in which the intent of the visitors is determined. You can
see the powhiri protocol demonstrated here in this village.
PATAKA: Storage House
canoe building, etc.
The food storage hut was also used to house heirlooms such as his jade pendants, weapons, adzes for
The Maori people ate fish, shellfish, birds, and small animals. They often salted, dried, or smoked
various food items and placed them in gourds for storage. Sweet potatoes, tapioca, an d the 'Maori
Potato' were food staples.
They also used roofed storage pits. These are partially underground with drainage on the sides of the
house. They were not only used to store food, but also to store the plants which would be used next
season.
As with other Polynesians, the Maoris cooked in open-air cooking spaces, in underground ovens called
a hangi. A pit was dug and logs were placed inside with rocks on top of the logs. As the logs burned,
the rocks fell into the pit. The food was then placed on the hot rocks and covered with leaves or mats
to keep the heat in for several hours, steaming the food.

Other methods used were geothermal steaming, grilling food on sticks over embers, wrapping food in
clay or leaves and placing them on the embers, boiling food by placing red-hot stones in wooden bowls
of liquid.
WHARE TUPUNA: Ancestral Meeting House
The Whare Tupuna, or the Ancestral Meeting House, is typical of those found in Maori villages in New
Zealand. Such buildings are very important to the Maori people because this is where customs and
ceremonies are maintained and perpetuated. In 1960, this particular building was commissioned,
carved in New Zealand under the direction of Master Carver Hone Taiapa and shipped to Hawaii piece
by piece where it was then put together for use here at the Polynesian Cultural Center.
This ancestral meeting house is named after Hawaikiroa, an ancient mariner who arrived in these
islands (now known as Hawai’i) over 2,000 years ago, and according to legend, named them after
himself.
The architecture and design of the building is full of symbolism. It represents the physical anatomy of
the human body of the ancestor for whom the building is named. The apex of this building has two
figures, the lower one, holding a paddle is Hawaikiroa, the common ancestor. The figure at the very
top, represents his son. The facing boards on the gable of the house represent his outstretched arms,
hands and fingers extended and reaching towards the ground. The ridgepole of the house represents
his spine or backbone and the painted rafters, his rib cage.
Inside, the intricately carved figures on the walls represent the genealogy and family history of a tribe.
Each figure or poupou depicts a specific ancestor and indicates information about him and his
accomplishments. The eyes in the carvings were made from paua shell also known as abalone. The
carvings depict tattooed faces, piercing eyes, protruding tongues and flexed leg muscles in dancing or
fighting positions. These same traditional gestures are used today in dances performed in New
Zealand and here at the Polynesian Cultural Center.
A person’s status in the community was determined by his bloodline. Hence, it was crucial for the
Maoris to memorize and recite their genealogies. These carved figures are constant reminders to the
people of their ancestry. The stories, histories and genealogies of these ancestors continues to be
preserved in the carvings, the oral history and music of the people. The present generation continue to
bear their names.
Painted scroll ornamentations on the rafters are more than just decorative. They’re called kowhaiwhai
(circles within circles). They represent various foods and plants such as the sweet potato, peas, berries,
and curling fern and are symbolic of nature and its importance. They tell stories of local history,
symbolize aspects of the natural world and represent genealogies.

Between the carvings are the tukutuku panels that are woven by Maori women. Each design depicts a
particular tribal historical legend that is passed from generation to generation through the weaving of
these panels. The set of six panels on a stand at the end of the room tells the story of the original Maori
migration to New Zealand. They are woven from the dried leaves of the kiekie vine, which is found
abundantly throughout New Zealand. The yellow and white colors are the natural shades after drying
has taken place.
KIA NGAWARI:
Kia Ngāwari houses examples of the art of Māori weaving. Weaving techniques, include finger-weaving
(related to twining), ornamental lattice work, patterned strand work, braiding, weft twining and
plaiting.
One of the more important varieties of native plant species found in Aotearoa New Zealand is the flax
plant. The leaves can be used to craft mats, hats, bags, baskets, and even sails. The exposed inner
fibers can be dyed and braided or woven into rope, fishing nets and the flax-made kilts used in the
performing arts. Without the use of looms, weavers use the fibers to weave cloth, very similar to
linen, which can be used as a wrap-around cloak. Many cloaks today are beautifully adorned with
feathers.
KUPE:
The exhibit inside of this carved meeting house, highlights the art of Maori carving.
· Case #1 - Wood: Examples of long and short clubs made from native hardwood.

· Case #2 - Stone: Examples of Nephrite Jade, Argillite, Garnet (used as a hammer stone), Obsidian
and Sandstone.
· Case #3 - Bone / Teeth / Shell: Examples of 8 shark species (found in Aotearoa New Zealand
waters), abalone and whalebone.
· Case #4 - Traditional Facial Markings: Examples of a bone chisel, mallet, ink bowl, tree resin, carved

· Case #5 - Dye: Examples of flax fibers, mordant (substance used to set dye on fibers and fabric) was
made from the leaves of forest trees and shrubs, including the Celery Pine and Tea tree; forest tree
bark; and iron-rich mud.
· Photos on display include Hone Taiapa, MBE, the Master Carver; Matthew Cowley, the visionary of
the PCC; numerous previous employees of the marae (now deceased) and the Te Arohanui Māori
Company performers.
WAKA TAUA: War Canoe
This Waka Taua or war canoe of New Zealand is one of the greatest examples of Maori carving.
The canoe was named the ‘Long Fish of Māui’ (see Māui’s Legend above). Traditionally, a war canoe
was used as a raiding vessel along the coastlines, inland lakes and rivers. Fully manned, it could
reach a speed of up to 15 miles per hour (13 knots) for short distances. In some canoes, sails were also
rigged to add to the speed.
HISTORY OF THE WAKA TAUA (WAR CANOE): TE IKA-ROA-A-MĀUI - The Long Fish of Māui
On the 6th of March 1948, it was announced that King George VI (r 1936-1952) and Queen Elizabeth would
embark on a Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand the following Spring of 1949, accompanied by their
daughter Princess Margaret. They would be the first reigning monarchs to visit both countries.
(National Portrait Gallery, London - 1951)
As part of the many preparations that took place for this tour to New Zealand, a giant Kauri (Agathis
Australis) tree from the Puketi State Forest, Northland was felled in October of 1948.
A Waka Taua (War Canoe) was to be crafted from this tree and used as part of the welcome ceremony for the
Royal Family by the Ngāpuhi people.
In addition, the canoe was to be presented as a gift to His Royal Highness.

On the 23rd of November 1948, the tour was cancelled due to the King’s declining health. However, the work
of construction carried on until the hull of the canoe was sufficiently completed to be transported out of the
bush. The canoe was brought to rest near the Kohewhata Marae Hall, Mangakahia Rd, Kaikohe.
The idea to complete the canoe resurfaced in the early 1960’s due to the Polynesian Village’s Project, which
was already underway in Lā’ie, Hawai’i and Tuhikaramea, Aotearoa, NZ.
Members of the Witehira, Wihongi and Tahere families are pictured here donating the hull of the canoe to the
Polynesian Villages Building Committee Supervisor, John Elkington, Sr. (front left) in la te 1962.

Hone Taiapa was the Master Carver of the meeting house in Hawai’i, Hawaikiroa.
He called on Piri Poutapu, also a Master Carver, to oversee the completion of the canoe.
Two other experienced carvers joined the team to complete the canoe under his direction.

TREE SPECIES:
KAURI
Agathis australis, commonly known by its Māori name Kauri, is a coniferous tree of the Araucariaceae in the
genus of Agathis. Kauri trees can grow to over 50 metres (160+ feet) tall and up to 7 metres (23 feet) in
diameter.
TŌTARA
Podocarpus totara (tōtara) is a species of podocarp tree. Tōtara trees can grow up to 40 metres (130 feet) tall
and over 6 metres (16 feet) in diameter.
Te Ika-roa-ā-Māui is 18.2 metres (60 feet) and weighs close to 2500 kgs or 2 ½ tons. This canoe carries between
34 - 40 people inclusive of the paddlers, the steersman, the leader, and a bailer.

MAORI WARRIORS:
This is a Taiaha. The Taiaha served as a broadsword quarterstaff, club, and spear. It is a fire-hardened
wooden stave that had a long tapered, flattened shaft or blade, which broadens towards the end and
has a head, nose, eyes, lips, teeth, and mouth, with a tongue-shaped spearhead on the opposite end.
The ancient Maori chiefs at ceremonial gatherings also used the taihaha. The Maori orator when making
a speech emphasized his words with gestures and taiaha actions called taki.
The taiaha and greenstone mere (flat club) were both perfect weapons for close quarters combat. The
advantage of a shorter club like the mere is its portability. It was usually tucked into the back
waistband of the warrior’s skirt and hidden from sight behind a cloak.
Weapons were often named after an ancestor.
ACTIVITIES:
Tītī-tōrea
Traditionally, this game was one of many military games played in childhood. The objective of the
game was to develop and maintain effective eye-hand coordination skills, essential in future hand-to-
hand combat. The game still teaches those same skills today.
It requires players to simultaneously toss sticks back and forth to each other in various patterns and in
rhythm to music or chant. Players try to catch the sticks without dropping any of them and to have
fun.
Long-Poi

Poi is a light ball on a string of various lengths, swung or twirled rhythmically and in unison to sung
accompaniment. Traditional poi can be made from bullrush (cat’s tail leaves) and attached to a flax
cord or rope. Modern-day poi can be made with foam and plastic, while the handle can be plaited
from yarn or cord.
Poi can be struck with either side of the hand and shoulder to create a percussive rhythm, imita te the
sounds, movements and rhythms of nature. Matched with song, it can be used to enhance
storytelling.`,
      history: 'The Māori people arrived in Aotearoa around 1250-1300 CE in great voyaging canoes (waka). According to legend, Kupe and Ngake ventured southwest from Tahiti following navigational instructions left by the hero Maui. Kupe\'s wife sighted clouds and called "He ao! He ao!" (A cloud!), giving Aotearoa its name meaning "Land of the Long White Cloud." European contact began in 1642 with Abel Tasman, followed by Captain James Cook (1769-1777). The Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840. The current population is 5.1 million, with 17% being native Māori.',
      culture: 'Māori culture emphasizes whakapapa (genealogy), mana (prestige), and kaitiakitanga (guardianship). The marae (communal meeting ground) is central to community life and connects people through genealogy. Traditional arts include whakairo (carving), tā moko (tattooing with bone chisels), and kapa haka (performing arts). The whare tupuna (ancestral meeting house) represents the physical anatomy of an ancestor - the ridgepole is the spine, rafters are ribs, and carvings (poupou) depict genealogy with paua shell eyes.',
      traditions: 'The pōwhiri is a traditional welcome ceremony featuring the karanga (call), haka (challenge), and hongi (pressing of noses to share the "ha" or breath of life). The hangi is traditional earth oven cooking using geothermal steam or hot stones. Wharenui (meeting houses) represent ancestors and tell tribal stories through carvings and tukutuku panels woven by women. The puhara (watchtower) protected villages, with scouts blowing the pukaea (wooden trumpet) to warn of strangers. Tītī-tōrea (stick game) and poi develop coordination skills.',
      language: 'Te Reo Māori is an official language of New Zealand. Common phrases: Kia ora (hello/thank you), Haere mai (welcome), Aroha (love), Kia Ngāwari (take it easy). The language experienced revival efforts starting in the 1980s with Māori language nests (kōhanga reo). The famous war canoe Te Ika-roa-a-Māui (The Long Fish of Māui) was built in 1948 and is 18.2 meters long, crafted from Kauri and Tōtara wood by master carvers Hone Taiapa and Wiremu Piri Poutapu.'

      overview: `Greeting Word: Aloha
Current Population: 1.3 million
Hawai’i, at the northern apex of the Polynesian Triangle and the only major
part of Polynesia above the equator, is located approximately 2,500 miles
[4,000 km] west south west of the US Mainland. Eight major islands (seven
inhabited) and over 100 smaller ones cover approximately 6,400 square miles
[16,600 km².] The climate ranges from tropical rainforests to high volcanic
peaks covered in winter snow.
Factoid: Some modern Hawaiians are striving to re-establish a recognized
form of sovereignty, perhaps similar to Native American Nations in other
parts of the U.S.

HAWAII
“ALOHA!” is the greeting word for Hawaii.
The Hawaiian greeting of ALOHA is probably the most well known Polynesian word. Of the more than twenty
islands in the Hawaiian group, only seven are inhabited. Hawaii spreads over a distance of about 400 miles.
The eight main islands (seven of which are inhabited) are volcanic islands while the others are small coral
islands. Together, they comprise about 6,424 square miles of land. The population of approximately 1.3million
(80% of which live on Oahu) is composed of a mixture of Polynesians, Asians, and Caucasians.
Hawaii has a mild, tropical climate with seasonal temperature fluctuations of only about 10 degrees. The islands
are exposed to yearly Northeast trade winds. More rain falls on the island of Kauai than on any other spot on
earth. The first Hawaiians migrated from the Marquesas Islands approximately 30-40 generations ago settling
first on Kauai and Oahu. A late migration from Tahiti settled on Hawaii and Maui. Many have tried to discover
when the migrations took place, but no one knows the exact date. Communication between Hawaii and Tahiti
remained active.
After an initial discovery by the Spaniard Gaetano, the Hawaiian Islands were rediscovered by Captain James
Cook in 1778. Captain Cook named the discovery the “Sandwich Islands” after his patron, the Earl of Sandwich.
King Kamehameha I united the islands into an independent kingdom in 1796. This period of royal rule
stretched until 1893 when Queen Liliuokalani’s monarchy was overthrown and Hawaii was annexed by the
United States of America in 1898. Later, in 1959, the Hawaiian Islands were officially named the "Aloha State"
when they officially joined the U.S. as its fiftieth state. Since gaining statehood, Hawaii’s economy has evolved
from one dependent on sugarcane and pineapple crops to a profitable economy based on tourism. It is Hawaii’s
largest source of revenue.
The official State bird is the Nene, or Hawaiian Goose, which is native to Hawaii and protected as an endangered
species. Prior to 1778 (when Capt. James Cook arrived) there were about 25,000 Nene. By the mid 1900's, wild
Nene numbered less than 30. Breeding programs at Slimbridge in England and Pohakuloa, Hawaii have helped
bring the current population in Hawaii up to about 3,000 birds.
The State Tree of Hawaii is the Candlenut or kukui, whose nut is rich with natural oils. The nuts of this tree
provided the ancient Hawaiians with light, oil, relishes, and medicine. The kernels are strung together with
coconut mid-ribs and lit to be used as candles. Each kernel has enough oil in it to burn for approximately eight
minutes. Because of it’s rich content, it was also used as a laxative. The oil was also used to partially waterproof
canoes and small water craft.
BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE VILLAGE:
This village is patterned after a typical Hawaiian family compound from around 1750 A.D. Each
family had a single-room hut which was used mostly for sleeping. In ancient Hawaii, each household
consisted of a number of separate, but associated huts that together comprised what was called the
‘kauhale’ (dwellings). Thus, each household could have several houses in one area, as well as a
different cluster in another area, and the ‘kauhale’ were frequently separated by some distance.
Further, there were specific functions assigned to various houses in each cluster, with certain
dwellings designated as sleeping huts, others for eating (men ate separately from the women and
children, for their eating hut was regarded as a religiously significant place in which food offerings
were made to the gods and ancestors), and cooking huts that consisted of stone walled areas with
thatched roofs for food preparation. There were other huts within the kauhale that were task specific
as well, such as those for canoe makers and others used to house fishing gear. These buildings
belonged to the entire village, and not to one particular family.
Hawaiian structures are covered with pili grass, which is found on higher altitudes. The grass is
bundled and layered on the cross beams and frames of the buildings. Pili grass contains a natural41
waxy substance that causes it to stick together when wet. This provides an ideal waterproof covering
for the buildings. This 'sticking together' is called pili in Hawaiian. When the leaves dry out, they
separate again, allowing for air circulation within the buildings.
The inside of the buildings are lined with lauhala, or pandanas leaves. This leaf is very universal in
Polynesia and is used by the islands people for weaving. Enclosed buildings typically did not have
windows or additional doors, and normally the doors were low and one had to bend down or crawl to
enter, however, for our guests’ convenience and ease of access, you will find normal doors and windows
on the structures here.
AHUPUA’A:
The concept of private property was unknown to ancient Hawaiians, but they did follow a complex
system of land division. All land was controlled ultimately by the highest chief or king who held it in
trust for the whole population. A whole island, or mokupuni, was divided in smaller parts, down to a
basic unit belonging to a single family.
Each mokupuni was divided into several moku, the largest units within each island, usually wedge-
shaped and running from the mountain crest to shore. O'ahu was divided into six moku.
Each moku was divided into ahupua'a, narrower wedge-shaped land sections that again ran from the
mountains to the sea. The size of the ahupua'a depended on the resources of the area with poorer
agricultural regions split into larger ahupua'a to compensate for the relative lack of natural abundance.
Each ahupuaa was ruled by an ali'i or local chief and administered by a konohiki.
42
Each ahupua'a contained the resources the human community needed, from fish and salt, to fertile land
for farming taro or sweet potato, to koa and other trees growing in upslope areas. Villagers from the
coast traded fish for other foods or for wood to build canoes and houses. Specialized knowledge and
resources peculiar to a small area were also shared among ahupua'a.
Although there was no private ownership of property, land tenure of the maka'ainana (commoners)
was stable. They paid weekly labor taxes and annual taxes to the konohiki, or local overseer, who
collected goods to support the chief and his court. The konohiki supervised communal labor within the
ahupua'a and also regulated land, water and ocean use.
Stewardship of the land and its resources was formalized through the kapu system. The kapu (taboo) -
administered and enforced by konohiki and kahuna, or priests - placed restrictions on fishing certain
species during specific seasons, on gathering and replacing certain plants, and on many aspects of social
interaction as well. In this way, the community maintained a sustainable lifestyle. Through sharing
resources and constantly working within the rhythms of their natural environment, Hawaiians enjoyed
abundance and a quality lifestyle with leisure time for recreation during the harvest season of the year.
This lifestyle also encouraged a high level of artistic achievement. Many crafts, including Hawaiian kapa
and featherwork, were the finest in the Pacific. Hawaiians devoted themselves to competitive sport and
martial arts as well as expression through dance and chant, creating rich traditions that continue today.
HALAU HO’IKE: Presentation House
A halau was a very important house in Hawaii. Within buildings like this, much of the culture, history
and heritage passed from one generation to the next. Knowledge was passed orally through stories,
chants and dances in special buildings such as this. It is a place of learning and growth.
HALE MUA: Men’s Eating House
In ancient Hawaii their religious beliefs and practices did not permit the family the opportunity to eat
together. This building, the Hale Mua, was used by the men for eating, training young men, and other
religious activities. The women of the family had their own eating-house called Hale ‘Aina. All children
would eat with their mother in the women’s eating-house until the young boy turned 8, 9 or 10. The age
varied in different areas. At that time he would move into the Hale Mua and learn the ways of men.
This type of societal rule called kapu, also prevented women from eating certain foods like bananas,
coconuts and specific types of fish. It was followed until the year after Kamehameha’s death, when
Liholiho (Kamehameha II) ate together with his mother, Ka’ahumanu, abolishing the kapu.
Image: Queen Ka’ahumanu, wife of Kamehameha the Great, mother of Liholiho (Kamehameha II).
The ipu is a gourd that grows like a pumpkin or a squash. The shell was used as a bowl or container.
The la’amia is another gourd, but this one grows on a tree. This gourd too is dried, hallowed and used
43
as a bowl. La’i or ti leaves are used like tin foil wrapping when doing barbques. They store the cooked
food in the leaf or wrap the raw foods in the leaf and cook it. Various woods were used as bowls and
trays as you can see.
In the corner of the building there are Ki’i or god images honored by the Hawaiian people. In
relationship to the gods, if the family had a problem that they could not solve the patriarch of the family
would sleep in this building and with the help from the gods, the solution to the problem would be
revealed in a dream.
HALE NOHO or HALE NOA: Family Dwelling
Of all the buildings used by the Hawaiian family, the hale noho had the least restrictions. In this
building the family could meet and share thoughts. The building was also used by the family as a
sleeping house. Because they lived with extended family and everyone slept together, there were
assigned area for sleeping. Children slept on the outer ends of the hales, and adult males slept closest
to the doors to protect their families in case of attack.
Beds were very simple. Pili grass and dried leaves were spread on the pebbled or sandy floors for
cushioning. Mats were often placed over the grass to serve as beds. During the day, they were put out
in the sun to cleanse and refresh them, then brought back in for use during the night.
HALE HANA: Work House or Workshop
The Hale Hana could be used for many different purposes. Hana means ‘to work’, so this is a workshop
used to make or do many different things, depending on what was needed for the village.
HALE ULANA: Weaving Hut
Weaving is done primarily with lauhala or Pandanas leaves. The pandanus tree has a fruit that
resembles, and is sometimes mistaken by visitors, for pineapple. The fruit on the tree is called puhala,
and when it ripens turns a bright red, yellow or orange depending on the variety of the tree. It is often
used for making leis. The fruit is made up of smaller sections that when united makes the ball you see
on the tree. These sections in ancient times, when ripe, were chewed on by the Hawaiian children and
used as a type of candy. One can also take these dried sections and peel them open for meat on the
inside that are like pine nuts. The skin is so tough, that adults used this only during times of famine
when there was nothing else available.
The leaves are picked and dried. Then the thorns down the sides and back are removed, the leaf is
cleaned, flattened, and stored in rolls called poka’a. When they need to weave they strip the leaves to
the appropriate size and commence making the items desired.
HALE ALI’I: Chief’s Council House
The Hale Ali'i represents the house of the ali’i or chief. It was built on the most prominent rise in the
area and was often further elevated by a stone platform. Besides establishing the owner’s elevated
social status, this architectural style also protected the house from floods. The exterior thatching is of
pili grass, which was sometimes then covered with large fishing nets to keep the grass from curling
and looking untidy. The roof in the interior was usually thatched with pandanus leaves, and mats
covered the floor. The Hale Ali’i was primarily a place for the chief to sleep, rest or confer with other
leaders. In ancient times the Hale Ali’i was forbidden to women and children.
All the items in this building are items related to the rule of the Chief. In ancient time feathers were like
diamonds to the Hawaiians. They were set aside and used to adorn people of nobility. Symbolic of the
chief’s prestige, the Hale Ali’i often had kahili displayed on the outside or the inside. These kahili, or
44
royal insignia, were made of feathers owned only by the Ali’i and are comparable to flags or banners
carried for the royal courts in Europe. The kahili always preceded the Ali’i to alert the people to bow
low as he approached as a token of respect. Similarly, the priests, or kahuna, would often precede the
Ali’i carrying the taboo staff, called pulo’ulo’u (a stick covered with a ball of white tapa material at the
top), which was intended to ward off evil spirits. This was used like a no trespassing sign. If the chief
wanted an area to remain private for his use, one would see this staff pegged in the area. If the chief was
in residence and did not want to be disturbed, you would see one outside the door.
The Ali’i, or High Chief, wore an ahu’ula or feathered cape. Many feathers they used were around the
size of a fingernail, so it took thousands of feathers for the making of these capes. There are two
distinguishing facts about these capes, the first being it’s size. The longer the cape, the higher the rank
of that chief. Also, the yellow or gold feathers of the birds were the most rare, so the more gold or
yellow on the cape, the higher the rank of that particular chief.
The lei niho pala’oa was worn by both men and women and was crafted from braided human hair and
highlighted with a pendant carved from a whale's tooth in the shape of a curving tongue.
The feathered crown or helmet is called the mahi’ole. There are two stories as to the shape of the helmet;
one speaks of the rainbow – a sign from the heaven. The other tells the story about the crest of the rooster
– a sign of authority. The helmet is made from the rootlets of the vine known as the ‘ie’ie which works
like rattan or wicker. After the frame is completed feathers may be added to it.
Other items used by the mo’i wahine, or lady in waiting, included the crown, or lei hulu, made from
feathers bound into a circlet for the hair or the neck, and finely woven lauhala fans and delicate
feather kahili with decorated handles.
HALE LAWAI’A: Fisherman’s Store House
This building was used by the fishermen to store items such as fish net, crab nets, weights, cordage, and
bamboo needed for making nets and other such items used by fishermen.
45
HALE NO’EAU: House of Games of Skill
This is another house of learning and holds games used by Hawaiians to develop physical and mental
skills needed for daily life.
HU: Hawaiian Spinning Tops
The kukui kernel is used for the making of tops such as these. This objective is to keep as many
tops spinning at the same time as possible.
KONANE: Hawaiian Checkers
In Hawaiian checkers every time you move you must jump over your opponent. The board is
a set up alternating dark and white pebbles. To start the game place a pebble in each hand, place
your hands behind your back and rotate the pebbles until satisfied. Bring hands to the front and
your opponent selects a hand. The white pebble jumps first so with the 4 spaces available in the
middle of the board the game starts rotating turns always jumping over and opponents pebble.
One can double or triple jump but only in the same direction. There are no diagonal moves, one
can only move up and down or from across.
ULUMAIKA: Lawn bowling
The original disks were made from stone. The objective is to roll the disks through the two pegs
at the end of the lane.
PALA’IE: Loop and Ball
Made from various parts of the coconut tree, this game starts with the ball in the loop. The
objective is to swing the ball towards you, hit it underneath of the loop swing it back towards
you and catch the ball in the loop. That is the basic, and from there one learns more tricks and
also learns with both hands.
HULA:
Hula today is commonly divided into two broad categories. Ancient hula, as performed before Western
encounters with Hawaii, is called kahiko. It is accompanied by chant and traditional instruments. Hula as it
evolved under Western influence, in the 19th and 20th centuries, is called ‘auana. It is accompanied by song
and Western-influenced musical instruments such as the guitar, the ukulele, and the double bass.
Hula is taught in schools called hālau. The teacher of hula is the kumu hula, where kumu means source of
knowledge. Hula dancing is a complex art form, and there are many hand motions used to signify aspects of
nature. The hand motions in hula are the focus, and different motions have different meanings. They tell the
story of the accompanying mele, or chant, and are meant to help convey the feelings and emotions of the
performers.
Hula kahiko encompassed an enormous variety of styles and moods, from the solemn and sacred to
the frivolous. Many hula were created to praise the chiefs and performed in their honor, or in honor of
the gods.
This type of hula was considered a religious performance, rather than entertainment, which is why
you will notice that the dancers do not smile while they perform. As was true of ceremonies at the
he’iau (temple), even a minor error was considered to invalidate the performance. It might even be a
presage of bad luck or have dire consequences. Dancers who were learning to do such hula necessarily
made many mistakes. Hence they were ritually secluded and put under the protection of the goddess
Laka during the learning period. Ceremonies marked the successful learning of the hula and the
emergence from seclusion.
46
Hula kahiko is performed today by dancing to the historical chants. They are accompanied by
chanting and the beating of the ipu heke, or gourd drum and performed with a reverence for their
spiritual roots.
Hawaiian history was oral history. It was codified in genealogies and chants, which were memorized
strictly as passed down. In the absence of a written language, this was the only available method of
ensuring accuracy. Chants told the stories of creation, mythology, royalty, and other significant even ts
and people.
Hula ‘auana, or modern-style hula, arose from adaptation of traditional hula ideas (dance and mele)
to Western influences. The primary influences were Christian morality and melodic harmony. Hula
‘auana still tells or comments on a story, but the stories may include events since the 1800s and are
more of an entertaining nature. The music is heavily Western-influenced, and usually includes the
accompaniment of less traditional instruments, like the guitar, steel guitar and ukulele.
There are two songs that are sung as guests learn the hula ‘auana in the Hawaiian village:
I Don’t Like Shoes I don’t like shoes upon my feet To be at ease is such a treat and I smile at everyone I meet; That’s the Hawaiian in me. Along the Beach
Along the beach at Waikiki
A fair wahine is waiting for me,
With nice eyes and lovable charms
And a sweet Hawaiian hospitality.
LO’I KALO: Taro patch or pond
Lo‘i kalo are ponds for wetland kalo that are enclosed by banks of earth. They are constructed
near kahawai (streams) because they are irrigated with stream water. The Hawaiians used a system that
allowed water from the stream to run through an ‘auwai(ditch) into the uppermost lo‘i kalo and flow
through the openings in the terraces to each lower lo‘i kalo. The water is eventually discharged back into
the stream. Many steps went into making a lo‘i kalo.
LOKO I’A: Fish Pond
Ancient Hawaiians had the most advanced fish husbandry system of the different island-nations of
the Pacific. They built fishponds along the shores and water inlets. They created rock walls that
allowed seawater to ebb and flow into the ponds. Gates built into the wall, would help circulate the
water, and also allow small fish into the pond. Once the fish were in, they would eat the algae and
other foods provided by the villagers. As they became larger, the fish would no longer be able to
leave the pond through the gates, becoming trapped inside. In this way, Hawaiians were always able
to maintain a readily available fish supply, which is important, since fish was their main form of
protein.`,
      
      history: 'Ancient Hawaiians arrived from Marquesas Islands around 400 CE, with a second wave from Tahiti around 1000 CE. King Kamehameha I unified the islands in 1810. Captain James Cook rediscovered Hawaii in 1778, naming them the "Sandwich Islands." Hawaii became a US territory in 1898 and the 50th state in 1959. The population is approximately 1.3 million, with 80% living on Oahu. Queen Lili\'uokalani\'s monarchy was overthrown in 1893. The famous Hamana Kalili, born in La\'ie (1882-1958), is credited as the father of the shaka sign after losing three middle fingers in a sugar mill accident.',
      culture: 'Hawaiian culture centers on aloha (love and compassion), \'ohana (family), and mālama \'āina (caring for the land). The kapu system regulated ancient society, prohibiting men and women from eating together until 1819 when Liholiho (Kamehameha II) ate with his mother Ka\'ahumanu. The ahupua\'a system divided land from mountain to sea, managed by konohiki who regulated resources sustainably. Traditional practices include hula kahiko (ancient hula with ipu drums), hula \'auana (modern hula with ukulele), oli (chant), and lua (martial art). Respect for kupuna (elders) is paramount.',
      traditions: 'The lei represents love and respect, given for celebrations and farewells. Luau feasts celebrate life events with traditional foods like kalua pig cooked in the imu (underground oven), poi, and laulau wrapped in ti leaves. Ho\'oponopono is a practice of reconciliation. Surfing (he\'e nalu) originated in Hawaii as the "sport of kings." The kahili (feathered staff) preceded chiefs, and the pulo\'ulo\'u (taboo staff with white tapa) marked kapu areas. Ali\'i wore ahu\'ula (feathered capes) and mahiole (feathered helmets), with yellow feathers being most rare and valuable.',
      language: 'Hawaiian (ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi) is one of two official state languages. Common phrases: Aloha kakahiaka (good morning), Aloha \'auinalā (good afternoon), Aloha ahiahi (good evening), Mahalo (thank you), ʻOhana (family). The language uses only 13 letters (5 vowels, 7 consonants, plus \'okina and kahakō). The \'okina (glottal stop) breaks vowel sounds, while the kahakō (macron) extends them. The state fish is the Humuhumunukunukuapua\'a, the state bird is the Nene (Hawaiian Goose), and the state tree is the kukui (candlenut).'

TONGA consists of more than 171 small groups of islands, which cover approximately 290 square miles of
land. Most of the islands of Tonga are low coral formations, except the Vava’u groups, which are of volcanic
origin. The climate is fairly cool, by tropical standards, with temperatures averaging about 80 degrees
between May and November and rising to about 90 degrees between December and April.
Tonga has a population of about 120,000 people. It is the last remaining kingdom in Polynesia and is the only
island nation with the distinction of having never being formally colonized by a European power. Throughout
World War II, at the first King’s request, Britain protected Tongan interests under various treaties, but Tonga
has always maintained her autonomy. The present King of Tonga is His Royal Highness King ‘Aho’eitu
Unuaki’otonga Tuku’aho Tupou VI (regnal name: Tupou VI) who was the successor to King George Tupou V
(his brother).
As we look at the huts or structures in the Tongan Village you will notice that they are shaped very much like
others of Polynesia, especially Samoan huts, except that Tongan huts have thatched walls. Tapa is usually used
to line the inside of the walls of Tongan structures called fale. The support structures are lashed together with
coconut sennit. In former times, no nails or screws were used to hold the buildings together. Other building
materials are used to give the structures a dome-shaped appearance, which being higher, gives more efficient
ventilation keeping the inside some what cooler.
FALE FAKATU’I: Queen Salote’s Summer House
This building is called the Fale Fakatu’i and it is the exact quarter scale model of the former queen’s
summer house in Tonga. Queen Salote, a beloved and revered figure in Tongan history, had this
structure built here at the Polynesian Cultural Center by her personal workmen. This fale is raised on
a rock platform and supported inside by four large ironwood posts, typical of Tongan architectural
style. One of the typical roofing materials in Polynesia is sugar cane leaves as it is used on this structure.
This royal house is highly decorated with elaborate
sennit lashings, fine reed walls, intricately woven
mats, and cowry shells. Dried coconut leaves are
placed on the floors and then covered with finely
woven mats which add extra softness.
The addition of this special structure at the Polynesian
Cultural Center was important enough to the royal
family of Tonga that the Crown Prince attended the
dedication ceremony in 1963 representing his family.
Inside, you will find pictures of Tongan royalty. One
picture is of King George Tupou I, who emancipated
his people and established a constitutional
government, based upon Christian principles --
mainly the Ten Commandments. Another picture is of
King George Tupou II. His daughter, Queen Salote
Tupou III, ascended to the throne in 1918 at the age of
eighteen, and ruled for 47 years until her death in 1965,
is also pictured. She was followed by King
Taufa’ahau Tupou IV, who passed away in 2007. He
is credited for doing much to further education in his
land, and has been awarded an honorary Doctorate
Degree from Brigham Young University for his
interest in the progress of his people.

API NOFO’ANGA: Family Dwelling
This structure is a typical dwelling house in Tonga. Behind the partition is the parent’s bedroom. The
bedding consists of layers of mats. Young children usually slept at the center of the fale. Each night
special mats were spread on which the children could sleep. In the morning the mats were rolled up so
that the center of the structure could also be used as the sitting room. As girls in the family reached
sixteen years of age, a partition was built to provide them with private sleeping quarters on the other
side of the building. At age sixteen boys slept in a separate structure built especially for them. The only
furnishings traditionally found in a Tongan home are mats and tapa cloth, which are used extensively
for decorating. The dwelling house is the scene for most family activities. Even the courting of
daughters by suitors takes place in the dwelling house so that all family members can evaluate various
young men.
FALE FAKAKOLO (also known as FALE FAKATAHA): Meeting House
Most village or community meetings are held in this meetinghouse. Civic problems, community
affairs are addressed and Kava ceremonies are performed here. Kava is often called "the official drink
of the Pacific.” In a kava ceremony, which is one of the highest forms of showing respect for guests or
village chiefs, the ranking chief sits on the elevated portion of the floor. The lower section of the floor
is for both men and women commoners. Anciently, village meetings took place once a month, but
today, meetings are held more frequently.
Kava has been part of Tongan formal ceremony and social culture for more than 2000 years. The kava
is made from the root of Pepper Methysticum, a native pepper plant. The root is first pulled from the
ground and washed. The outer skin is then scraped revealing the creamy colored core that is pounded
into a powder form. A special carved bowl is used for mixing the kava drink. The amount of water
needed to accommodate the number of participants is poured into the bowl. The kava powder is then
stirred in. A strainer made from the tangled fibers of the wild hibiscus bark is used to strain the kava
and obtain the clearest liquid possible. The kava is served in a half coconut shell cup. Kava, though
nonalcoholic, contains a mild narcotic that induces a state of restfulness and well being. There are no
hangover affects from kava.
FALE HANGA: Women’s Work House (Koka’anga or tapa-making & Weaving)
In Tongan society, this is the fale where women usually do their arts and crafts, such as tapa cloth
making. Tapa was used primarily for clothing and bedding. Today, however, tapa is used mostly at
ceremonial occasions for gift giving such a weddings or funerals and we also use it here in the islands
as dancing costumes.
Tapa cloth is made from inner bark of the
paper mulberry tree. Because the bark is
naturally hard and dry, it is first soaked in
fresh water overnight prior to working on
it. Women then gather the soaked bark
and place it on a tutua or large flat log and
begin to pound it with an ike or wooden
mallet. The inner bark soon thins out to
the point where holes begin to appear. It
takes about 45 minutes or more of
continuous pounding. The strips are then
hung in the sun to dry. A special glue
obtain from a half boiled tapioca is used to
glued the strips lengthwise and crosswise
which become what is called Tapa cloth.
63
Tapa varies from one Polynesian group to another. Tongans call it ngatu. In Samoa it is called siapo.
Fijians call this cloth masi. In Hawai’i it is called kapa. One way of distinguishing the various island
types of Tapa is in the designs. To make the designs on the tapa cloth, brown and black dyes are usually
used. The brown dye is obtained from the inner bark of the candlenut tree (kukui). Black dye is obtained
by boiling the brown dye with red hibiscus leaves and flowers.
Stencils (called kupesi in Tongan) are made from
the mid ribs of the coconut leaves, the threads are
from the wild hibiscus bark and the coconut fibers
as the backing board. The stencil being placed
under the cloth and the brown dye is rubbed onto
the cloth. The raised parts of the stencil pick up
more dye and so the designs and patterns stand out
more prominently on the cloth. Black dye is applied
with natural pandanus dried seed brushes after the
cloth has dried which completes the intricate
designs. The black and brown dyes are permanent
once they have dried. These days, the Tongan
people are some of the most active Polynesians in
preserving the traditional art of tapa-making. If you
were to go to Tonga today, you would most likely
hear the constant pounding of the ike or wooden
mallet against the tutua log as the women of Tonga
worked to make their prized tapa cloth.
LALANGA: (Weaving) The two plants that are important to the craft of weaving in Polynesia are
pandanus and coconuts trees. The pandanus leaves are favored for the weaving of the household items
such as floor mats, storage baskets, tablemats and fans. They were also used for canoe sails, bracelets
and footwear. These leaves were cut when they were still green and laid out to dry in direct sunlight.
After 2 weeks when the leaves are dried, they are twisted and hung for weeks. Then they are smoothed
out and rolled one after another into larger rolls of about a foot in diameter, and then they are secured,
stacked and stored for later use.
When the women are ready to use the leaves they are rubbed with a smooth shell until they are flat and
pliable. Then using a different shell they are cut according to their required width. The thinner the
strips the more important and valuable the project. The coconut leave is other important weaving
material in Polynesia. The leaves are cut right off the tree and utilized. Baskets, hats and bowls are
easily made because the leaves can be stripped off the main leaf. Coconut leaves provide an easy finish
off a house. They can be layered to make a roof, walls and used as screen out the wind and rain, or
made into mats used to line the floor over which fine mats would be used.
FALE PEITO: Cooking Hut
The Fale Peito is the cooking hut and is usually build away from other buildings in the home because
of the smoke and flame while preparing and cooking of food. The underground oven or ‘umu is usually
started once a day in early morning. The main hot meal of the day is eaten at noon . Enough food is
cooked in the umu so that there is enough for the whole day. However, the cooks have learned proper
placement of various food items in the umu to assure that proper temperatures are maintained as closely
as possible for the best possible cooking of the food.
The earth oven in Polynesian is the man’s domain because it is so physically demanding from the
beginning to the end. You must first dig a bowl-shaped pit, gather firewood preferably dried, good
burning twigs and branches and large rocks. The fire is started with dried coconut leaves and the dried
braches then the large firewood are placed into a sturdy flat shape. The rocks are then placed carefully
over the complete framework and the rocks are heated until they are grayish white in color. The
64
unburned woods are removed and the rocks are leveled to the bowl-shape again. The banana stumps
are then place on top of the hot rocks. The pit is then filled with food that had been prepared and then
covered them with a lot of banana leaves. The oven is totally covered with dirt to ensure that no steam
escapes from the mound.
Image: Food is laid out on banana leaves for all to share. Traditionally, there were no utensils and diners ate using
their hands.
This hut is usually divided into two sections, forming a kitchen and a dining area. After its ready, the
food is removed and taken to the dining area. Food is served and eaten on long trays called pola,
covered with banana leaves. Fingers, rather than utensils, are the exclusive means of eating. Meals,
which can consist of many different types of foods at once, including pork, suckling pig, fish, crayfish,
beef, octopus, and an array of tropical fruits are eaten sitting cross-legged on mats on the ground. For
each meal, new banana leaf “tablecloths” are provided.

      history: 'Tonga has been inhabited for over 3,000 years. The Tuʻi Tonga Empire ruled much of Polynesia from 950-1865 CE. Tonga never lost its sovereignty to colonial powers and remains the only Polynesian monarchy. The current dynasty was founded in 1845. King George Tupou I emancipated his people and established a constitutional government based on Christian principles. Queen Salote Tupou III ruled for 47 years (1918-1965) and was beloved worldwide. The current king is Tupou VI. Throughout WWII, Britain protected Tongan interests, but Tonga always maintained autonomy.',
      culture: 'Tongan culture emphasizes faka\'apa\'apa (respect), family loyalty, and the monarchy. The social hierarchy includes royalty (Ali\'i), talking chiefs (Tulafale), and commoners. The Ali\'i presides at councils while Tulafale serve as eloquent spokespersons skilled in lauga (oration). Traditional arts include ngatu (decorated bark cloth made from paper mulberry), lalanga (weaving pandanus and coconut leaves), and lakalaka (group dance). Gift-giving is central to relationships. Structures called fale have thatched walls with sugar cane leaf roofing.',
      traditions: 'The kava ceremony is a formal ritual for important occasions, representing peace, brotherhood and unity. Participants drink from the same coconut cup showing commitment to consensus. Sunday is strictly observed as a day of rest and worship, with all businesses closed. Traditional feasts (pola) celebrate weddings, birthdays, and milestones with abundant food displays on banana leaf "tablecloths," showing generosity and status. The \'umu (underground oven) is prepared once daily in early morning. Ngatu cloth takes about 45 minutes of pounding per strip, with designs applied using kupesi stencils.',
      language: 'Tongan is spoken by about 200,000 people worldwide. Common phrases: Mālō e lelei (hello), Mālō \'aupito (thank you), Nofo ā (goodbye). The language has formal registers used when addressing royalty or in ceremonial contexts. The letter "g" is always pronounced "ng" as in "singer," even at the beginning of words. Important buildings include fale fakatu\'i (queen\'s house), api nofo\'anga (family dwelling), fale fakakolo (meeting house), fale hanga (women\'s work house), and fale peito (cooking hut).'

      overview: `Greeting Word: Bula Vinaka
Current Population: 930,000
Fiji straddles the International Date Line about 3,100 miles [5,100 km]
southwest of Hawaii. The independent tropical nation covers approximately
7,050 square miles [18,270 km²] – slightly smaller than the U.S. state of New
Jersey – and includes two major islands plus about 330 smaller ones, and more
than 500 islets (tiny rock formations in the ocean that are unable to sustain
human habitation). The two main islands, Viti Levu & Vanua Levu, are rich in
resources, including gold and copper mines.
Factoid: The Fijians were historically known as fierce warriors until soon after
the paramount chief converted to Christianity in 1854.

FIJI
“BULA VINAKA” is the greeting word in Fiji.
The islands of Fiji are regarded as the “Crossroads of the South Pacific”, where Melanesia and Polynesia meet.
Although it’s geographical location defines it as part of Melanesia, the language and cultural aspects of Fiji more
closely relate it to Polynesia.
Other than New Zealand, the islands of Fiji are larger than the rest of the Polynesian groups. There are a little
over 330 islands, 500 islets, and there are very distinct cultural differences from island to island. Because of the
great distance covered by the islands of Fiji there are a number of dialects or distinct languages spoken by the
various islanders. The Fijian language is made up of approximately 20 dialects and with the multi-racial makeup
of the country today, English is used as the official language. Approximately one third of the islands are
inhabited.
The first Europeans to land and live
among the Fijians were shipwrecked
sailors and runaway convicts from the
Australian penal settlements. Dutch
explorer, Abel Tasman, is credited with
its discovery in 1643. Major credit for
recording of the islands on modern maps
went to Captain William Bligh who
sailed through Fiji after the mutiny on
the Bounty in 1789.
Great Britain ruled over Fiji from 1874
until 1970 when Fiji became an
independent dominion and removed
Queen Elizabeth II as the Head of State.
There were other political disturbances
in 1987, 2000, and 2006 while Fiji
struggled to determine its future.. The
population of Fiji is today close to
930,000 (87% of which live on Viti Levu
and Vanua Levu, the two main islands.
Suva, the largest city and capitol, is
located on Viti Levu.
About 40% of the people are descendants
of laborers brought from India almost a
century ago in the indentured labor
system, as contract workers for the sugar cane plantations. 50% of the population is made up of indigenous
Fijians. The remaining 10% is a mixture of other races, including Chinese and Caucasians.
The 20th century has brought important economic and political roles for Fiji. Fiji has been productive in its
sugar industry, copra milling, and tourism. Today, Fiji plays a major role in regional affairs and is recognized
as a focal point of the South Pacific.
The greeting of bula vinaka means more than just a simple hello. It literally means “Good Health” or “Good
Life”. In ancient times as people entered a Fijian village area, the lali, or wooden drum, would ring out to
announce the new arrival to the village.
32
BURE vs. VALE: Structures
There are two words that you will hear in Fiji referring to structures. One is bure and the other is
vale. Bure denotes the style of building and also a building used irregularly but for a specific purpose.
A vale denotes a structure used continually for domestic purposes, such as a family home, chief’s
home etc. You will notice that in most of the Bure very little furniture is found. The use of furniture
began as foreigners settled and brought other ways of life to Fiji.
BURE: Family Dwelling
This structure (see photo
below) is a typical bure or
house. Because Fiji consists of
many islands over a wide area,
house structures differ from
location to location. The
structures found here at the
Polynesian Cultural Center are
patterned after structures
found in the Lau group of the
islands of Fiji.
The Bure is constructed with
layered reed walls lashed
together with sennit. As in all
Fijian structures, tapa cloth, or
masi as it is called in Fiji, is
dominant as decoration. The colors of Fijian masi are usually darker than in other Polynesian
cultures. In ancient times, masi had specific patterns that indicated the area a designer came from.
They often had genealogical significance for a family.
The roof is covered with a
sugarcane leaf thatching.
To keep the thatching free
of insects or animals that
would feed on the leaves, a
fire is often built inside the
building. The smoke rises
into the thatching, forcing
most animal life out of the
leaves, similar to today’s
fumigation methods. Fijian
structures are usually
constructed with very high-
pitched roofs that allow for
better air circulation inside
and for the frequent Fijian
rain to easily run off on the
outside. The roofs have a
life expectancy of ten to
fifteen years depending
upon the craftsmanship.
This is what a typical village of bure would have looked like back in Fiji. (See image.)
33
VALE LEVU: Chief’s House
A traditional Fijian village includes the chief's house, the largest structure and most elevated building,
unless that village had a Bure Kalou (see ‘Bure Kalou’ section). The Chief’s house’s stature was further
marked with white cowry shells, which you can observe hanging on the doors and at various locations,
both inside and outside the house.
The front door in the east is the entryway for commoners and servants. The two side doors, facing north
and south, are entryways for the chief's wife and family and visiting dignitaries. The back door, always
facing the west, is reserved only for the chief himself. Anciently, armed warriors stood guard at the
chief’s door, and any person other than the chief who entered through it was put to death. Today, the
custom is still practiced, only without the warrior guards posted to enforce the protocol of tradition,
since it is a given that Fijians should know the correct door through which to enter.
The chief’s bed is made of piled-up pandanus mats topped with tapa cloth. Frequently, a bamboo frame
was utilized, again filled with layers of mats to ensure softness. The floor would have a layer of sand,
covered with layers of dried leaves and soft branches, upon which would be piled layers of mats.
The headrest seen on the bed is a typical Fijian pillow to keep the head elevated above the body. This
was necessary because the head was believed to be the location of the power of an individual. On a
more practical level, the luxurious Fijian "hair do" necessitated that shape of headrest. The lower bed is
for the chief's wife and children. If the chief practiced polygamy, the favored wife and her children
slept there. The other wives were sometimes provided sleeping quarters. At the opposite end of the
building, the chief would receive his guests and entertain them.
34
VALE NI BOSE: Meeting House
The Vale Ni Bose serves many purposes as it is used for ceremonial, official and private functions.
Ceremonial uses include the welcoming of village chiefs, discussing of official matters and the holding
of yaqona or kava ceremonies. During these meetings, women and children are forbidden in the
building. The yaqona or kava is a ceremonial drink that was served at these meetings. The root of the
kava, a plant of the pepper family, is dried and pounded into a powder, which is then mixed with water.
This drink is found in most cultures of the Pacific. As late as the 19th century, young maidens prepared
and served the kava to the elders of the village.
Women and children sometimes use this building as an arts and crafts center. The major art forms of
Fiji are weaving, carving and pottery making. Using the leaves of the pandanus plant does most
weaving. The thinner and closer the weaving, the more valuable the product was. Items woven include
mats, baskets, fans, etc. The making of pottery in Fiji is a Melanesian influence dating back earlier than
1300 B.C. Pottery making was apparently known and practiced in Samoa and Tonga originally but was
abandoned due to their lack of clay. Archaeologists have discovered bits of pottery as far east as the
Marquesas.
Lali or drums were used for long distance
communication. Through various rhythms a
message could be sent. Today a lali is used much
like a bell to call people to meetings or in time of
emergency. In ancient times the lali was used
during funerals and was beaten continuously,
night and day, until the funeral ended. Smaller
lali are used to accompany singing and dancing.
Another form of communication favored by the
Fijian people is the conch shell. After a hole is cut
in the side of the shell, it is played much like a
horn. Fishermen would blow it when returning to
the village, indicating a good catch.
DERUA: Bamboo Percussion Activity
Ancient and modern Fijian people used the DERUA or bamboo log, to provide rhythm as
accompaniment to music and dance. Holding a bamboo stick in each hand with the blocked end down,
the various lengths were pounded on the ground to create pitch and rhythm. With each hit, the air
within the hollow tube resonates, which results in a distinctive DERUA sound. The exact pitch or tone
is based upon the length of the bamboo and not the diameter. It has been found that DERUA can be
tuned in series with every 1/4 inch equaling a quartertone. The DERUA was a natural instrument in
Fiji. Bamboo grows hollow with a block at each joint. Lengths of bamboo were cut just below a joint
and all other blocks in the length were removed except the bottom one. All villagers could join in the
fun and festivity by pounding the DERUA.
35
BURE KALOU: Fijian Temple
The Bure Kalou or spirit house was usually built on the highest mound in a village, even higher than
the chief's house. Strings of buli vulavula, or white cowry shells, hung from the lore or the two fern
stumps at the end of the highest point of the roof. The white cowry always indicated the highest form
of respect. In the bure kalou, the village bete, or priest, would sit inside at the bottom of a long strip of
masi, or white tapa hung from the ceiling of the structure. He was the only person allowed inside the
spirit house. The priest was thought to be conversing with the ancestral god, through the long strip of
masi. It was thought that in order to be successful in battle or leadership, the chief had to take food
offerings and sacrifices to the bure kalou regularly and consult with the bete.

36
VALE NI KURO: Cooking Structure
The Fijian underground oven is called LOVO, which is basically a pit dug in the ground in which wood
and stones are placed for a fire. In other parts of Polynesia, it is known as an IMU or UMU. When the
wood burns down and the stones reach a high temperature, the food, which has been wrapped in leaves
to prevent scorching, is placed in the lovo. Ti leaves, breadfruit and banana leaves are most often used.
More leaves are used to cover the wrapped food. The complete lovo is then covered with earth to seal
the steam, which cooks and flavors the food.
Fijian people eat many various fruits and vegetables, including breadfruit, sweet potatoes, bananas,
tapioca, taro, and papaya. Fijians are also excellent fishermen and so their diet includes all forms of
fish, shellfish, and other edible sea life. Wild pigs and chickens are plentiful throughout the islands of
Fiji. When the first migrants arrived in the Pacific, they brought with them the pig and the dog from
Asia. Other livestock such as cattle and horses were not introduced until as late as the 15th & 16th
centuries.
COPRA:
The coconut is the most versatile and useful of all Polynesian plants. Copra is the dried flesh of
the coconut and used to be one of Fiji's major exports before it was surpassed by sugar cane
production. To make copra, a coconut is opened and the flesh is left in the sun to dry. From
the dried coconut, the rich oil is extracted. Both the fresh and dried flesh of the coconut is used
in various ways. The coconut flesh can be grated into coconut oil and then used for candles,
cosmetics, and soap or in cooking. The list of ingredients of many commercial products
including prepared foods and cosmetics includes the use of the coconut as one of the main
ingredients.
The fibers of the husk are braided to make sennit cord used to lash all buildings together. A
common use of husk fibers is as a scrubber for kitchen utensils and the body. The Fijians also
hollowed out the coconut shells for drinking cups, soap dishes, water bottles and containers
plus a myriad of other uses. When charcoal is needed, they burn coconut shells. Coconut milk
is put in an airtight container to which flower petals and fragrant leaves are added. The
container is left in the sun for several days. New petals and leaves are added daily until the
coconut oil is clarified and ready to use as moisturizing lotion or soap.
37
CAMAKAU: Fijian Canoe
Canoes played an important role in the lives of the Fijians; they were used for social purposes, economic
reasons (trade) and for the most part political purposes. In times of war, canoes such as this were used
in sea battles for ramming enemy canoes as well as transporting warriors to sites of land battle. Superior
canoes conferred political advantage to an island, which resulted in both protection, and the ability to
conquer other islands.
This is a Fijian Camakau (tha-ma-kau) or, a Fijian outrigger canoe. The Fijians are considered as some of
the finest canoe builders in the South Pacific. This particular canoe was constructed on an island east of
the main Fijian island group, known as KABARA. The men on this island were born craftsmen who were
very skilled canoe builders. In Fiji there are four classes of canoes:
1) “Drua” which is a double hulled canoe, and the largest class of canoes.
2) “Takia” which is a smaller outrigger canoe with a dugout hull.
3) “Camakau” which is a larger outrigger canoe with a covered hull
4) "Tabilai" a war canoe with thick ends used for ramming.
This particular canoe was built in 1985 and completed in just two months. After all the required rituals
and tests, this canoe was shipped to Hawaii by the then Prime Minister of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara,
who is considered by many to be the Founding Father of the modern-day Fiji. The island of Kabara
where this canoe was built is part of the Lau group.
This camakau was built using both modern and traditional tools. The tree was felled in the forest and
then moved to a convenient place, not too close to the village, where it was built. This historical event
was recorded and documented for the nearby Brigham Young University – Hawaii. It was presented
to PCC and BYU-Hawaii to be an educational tool for Pacific Island Studies majors.
38
One of the most unique features of a camakau is its ability to change direction without taking time to
turn around. By merely adjusting the position of the sail, a camakau can go in the opposite direction
without having to turn around like other sailing vessels. Canoes like this normally travel at speeds up
to 8 – 9 miles per hour, but are capable of even greater speeds.
More than 30 different plant species were used in the construction of this canoe. For example, this canoe
was built from a single 40 foot VESI LOG, or HEARTWOOD. The outrigger is made out of
NOKONOKO (Ironwood). Typically, the CAMA (Tha-ma - outrigger) would be made from UTO
(breadfruit tree). It is all lashed together with the MAGIMAGI or sennit rope braided from fibers of the
coconut husk.
The owner of a camakau was usually a chief, a village or an extended family due to the expenses
involved in owning a canoe, such as the many feast and presentations associated with the construction
of such a canoe.
FIJIAN WEAPONS:
A little over a hundred years ago, the
Fijians were using many types of clubs.
Apart from the gadi, a small ornamental
club carried by correctly dressed
warriors and chiefs at peacetime
ceremonial occasions, all clubs were used
for war. They were therefore made of the
hardest woods, such as ironwood or vesi.
Many had fine linear carving on their
handles, designed by the individual
warrior who made and used the club.
The Iula were throwing clubs with short
handles and bulbous heads. These were
the most deadly Fijian clubs capable of
competing with revolvers in close
situations. If the handle struck the
victim first it could penetrate the flesh,
the heavy head jack-knifing onto the
victim even if the handle did not pierce
him, thus dealing a crippling, if not
finishing blow.
The cai or qata, the spurred or "gun
stock" clubs (so-called because of their
resemblance in appearance to rifle butts or
stocks), are designed for cutting and
disjointing blows. That of a rifle did not
inspire their shape although they look
similar to one, but rather by the shape of
the “bird of paradise” flower.
The waka or the root club had straight
handles with a natural knot of roots at the
end and were used to crush skulls easily.`,
      history: 'Fiji was settled around 3,500 years ago by Austronesian peoples, later influenced by Melanesian culture. Dutch explorer Abel Tasman discovered it in 1643, with major credit going to Captain William Bligh who sailed through after the Bounty mutiny in 1789. The islands were unified under Chief Cakobau in 1871. Fiji became a British colony in 1874 and gained independence in 1970. The population is nearly 930,000 (87% on Viti Levu and Vanua Levu). About 40% are descendants of Indian indentured laborers, 50% are indigenous Fijians, and 10% are other races.',
      culture: 'Fijian culture centers on vanua (land and people), loloma (love and hospitality), and communal living. The mataqali (clan) system organizes society. Chiefs (turaga) command great respect. Traditional practices include meke (dance and storytelling accompanied by lali drums and conch shells), pottery-making (a Melanesian influence dating to 1300 BCE), and masterful navigation. The bula greeting means "good health" or "good life." Structures include bure (special purpose buildings) and vale (domestic dwellings). Camakau (outrigger canoes) from Kabara island can change direction without turning around.',
      traditions: 'The yaqona (kava) ceremony welcomes visitors and marks important events. Anciently, young maidens prepared it, but now it\'s mixed with water and strained through hibiscus bark. Lovo is traditional underground cooking where food wrapped in ti, breadfruit, or banana leaves is placed on hot volcanic rocks. The bula spirit embodies the warm, welcoming Fijian character. Traditional warriors performed the cibi war dance (which influenced modern rugby). War clubs included iula (throwing clubs deadly as revolvers), cai/qata (gun stock clubs), and waka (root clubs for crushing skulls). Copra (dried coconut) was a major export.',
      language: 'Fijian (iTaukei) and Fiji Hindi are spoken alongside English (official language). Common phrases: Bula vinaka (hello/good health), Vinaka (thank you), Moce (goodbye). The language has about 20 dialects across island groups, with standard Fijian based on the Bauan dialect. When visitors arrived anciently, the lali (wooden drum) would announce them. The conch shell was blown by fishermen to signal a good catch. Fijians were historically fierce warriors until Chief Cakobau converted to Christianity in 1854.'

      overview: `Greeting Word: Ia Orana
Current Population: 180,000-Tahiti (280,000- French Polynesia)
The island of Tahiti, administrative center of French Polynesia, often
represents all of the 116 surrounding tropical high rise islands and atolls in the
Society Islands, Austral Islands, Tuamotus, Gambier and Marquesas Islands.
Tahiti is located approximately 2,700 miles [4,350 km] southeast of Hawaii or
about half-way between South America and Australia. The combined land
mass covers about 1,400 square miles [13,660 km²]
Factoid: Tahitian craftsmen sometimes bury newly carved wooden drumsticks
in mud for several years before using them to assure just the right degree of
hardness and proper tuning.

TAHITI
“IA ORANA!” is their greeting word in Tahiti.
Welcome to the Island of Tahiti. Tahiti is just part of one of five island groups (the Society Islands, the
Marquesas Islands, the Austral Islands, the Tuamoutu Islands, and the Gambier Islands) that make up the
nation of French Polynesia which consists of a total of 116 islands. These islands are spread out over an ocean
area as large as the continent of Europe. French Polynesia is a semi-autonomous overseas territory of France,
with its own president, parliament and laws. France's influence is limited to subsidies, education and security.
The first European discoverer of Tahiti was Captain Samuel Wallis of the British Royal Navy in 1767, although
Tahiti didn’t become very well-known in Europe until Wallis was followed by French Navigator Count Louis
de Bougainville (1768) who published Voyage autour du monde. In his book, Bougainville described the island as
an earthly paradise where men and women live happily in innocence, away from the corruption of civilization.
The Tahitian population went into a period of decline in the 19th Century due largely to the introduction of new
diseases by Europeans to which the Tahitians had no natural immunity. In this century, however, the Tahitian
population has grown at a steady upward rate. The current population of all of French Polynesia is about
280,000, with 180,000 living on the island of Tahiti. An interesting statistic from French Polynesian today is that
more than half of the population is under the age of 20. The approximate racial breakdown of the Tahitian
population is 70% Polynesian, 12% European, 10% Polynesian/European, 5% Chinese, and 3%
Polynesian/Chinese. All are French citizens.
The first inhabitants of this area are believed to have arrived about in the islands around 830 A.D. Tahitians
remained isolated until the late 18th century when the British and French entered into a long series of political
maneuvers which lasted over 50 years. Finally, by 1842, the French were in full control, although formal French
rule had to wait until 1880, with the abdication of King Pomare V in favor of French rule. On July 14, 1977,
France granted Tahiti the right to be self-governing. Tahitians have been French citizens since 1946 and speak
the official languages, French and Tahitian.
54
The primary resources of Tahiti, besides the key industry of tourism, are the products of the coconut such as
copra which is sun dried coconut meat, and refined coconut oil known as monoi which is used as skin care
and suntan lotion. Secondary resources include mother of pearl shells, cultured pearls, fish, vanilla and more
recently, the cultivation of the noni fruit for its health and nutritional properties.
FARE TAUTAI: Fisherman’s Hut
A Tahitian family which lived near the sea would most probably have had a fishing hut made out of
bamboo lashed together. The roof is covered with bundled coconut leaves or with sugar cane leaves.
This hut would contain minimal furnishings. Sometimes it may have a bed, fish traps hanging from
special hooks, a bench or other types of seating, fishing poles, gourds used as containers, nets, ropes
and other equipment needed to catch fish efficiently.
Tahitian fish traps were not actually used to
trap fish but to store them. The fish were
caught first whether by a’ira (line) or upe’a
(net) and then placed inside the bamboo trap
or ha’ape’e. The door was then closed and
the whole trap placed in the water and kept
halfway afloat using floats attached on either
side. Floats were carved out of burau (balsa)
or wild hibiscus wood. Thus the fish are kept
alive so whenever fresh fish is needed, they
are readily available in the bamboo trap.
Each night the fisherman brings all his nets,
nape or taura (ropes), auri patia i’a (fishing
spears), traps, and other equipment inside his
shed for repair and safekeeping. The next morning, he is ready to start a new day of tai’a or fishing.
From small sheds such as this, fishermen wait for the right time to go fishing, while contemplating the
beauty of their islands, or chatting with a friend, or watching over their pearl crop.
Diving for mother pearls, an ancient
and high risk method practiced by the
people of the Tuamotu to obtain, on
rare occasions, a black pearl from a
mother pearl, has quickly become a
thing of the past since the introduction
of black pearl farming by Japanese
experts in the late 70's. With the aid of
modern technology and a new method
of farming the mother pearl, this dying
source of industry was quickly revived
as the black pearl business began to
boom throughout the Tuamotu islands.
Fortunately, due to the lack of
pollution in Tahitian waters and the
perfect temperature of the blue
lagoons, the black pearls have since
then been considered to be the most beautiful poe rava or black pearls in the world. As such, it has
rapidly ranked as one of French Polynesia’s highest resource of industry, second only to tourism.
FARE HEIVA: Place of Celebration
55
This tahua orira’a or traditional dance platform is elevated for better viewing of the special daily
programs which take place here. The songs and dances of Tahiti which you will see here will be
performed in their native language. All Tahitians also speak French which is taught to them once they
enter school. The tradition of entertainment in Tahiti once centered on a special guild of traveling
performers called the arioi. They sailed on great double canoes from bay to bay and island to island
performing dance, pantomime dramas, and chants honoring the god Oro, deity of peace, agriculture
and fertility.
The Tahitian islanders in this village will demonstrate the pa’oti and tamure, the graceful yet energetic
hip-shaking dance which young and old perform throughout the islands. One of the most widely
recognized images of the islands is the world famous Tahitian tamure, often confused with Hawaiian
Hula. This dance, easily recognized by its "fast hip-shaking," and "grass skirts" (see below for actual
material used to make these skirts) is often confused with the Hawaiian Hula, a generally slower dance
which focuses more on the hands and story telling than the hips.
The compelling rhythm of the dance is provided by the to’ere or a horizontal slit-gong wooden drum,
and the fa’atete or upright wooden drum similar to the snare drum but covered with goat or shark skin.
The pahu tupa’i, beaten by hands, and the tari parau beaten with drumsticks, are drums made from the
cow hide or sharkskin.
Some of the dances or songs will feature the more modern
instruments such as the guitar and a special version of the
ukulele, popularly known as the Tahitian banjo, which have
become vitally important to our music, since their introduction
by European settlers.
Contrary to popular belief, Tahitian dancing skirts are not made of grass. Dancing skirts in Tahiti are made out
of the inner fiber of the fau, or wild hibiscus tree. The women strip off the outer bark of the hibiscus and soak
56
the remaining branches in water. They then strip off the inner bark and dry it in the sun. After the silky inner
bark is dried, it is shredded into very narrow strips. The strips are bundled into small clumps and tied onto a
waistband also made of the strips. Skirts worn by women for dancing can weigh as much as seven or eight
pounds. The dancers find that the heavier the skirt, the better it sways when they move their hips in the fast-
shaking
Tassels and shells are placed on the waistband for decoration as well as to accentuate the movement of
the hips. In addition, the weighty waistband helps to weigh down the skirts to prevent them from
slipping off during the aggressive dancing. Women’s skirts extend down to the ankles, while men’s
skirts extend just below the knees. On festive occasions, dancers try to wear the most elaborately
decorated dancing outfits.
When making shell leis many shells of the same size must be individually punched with a sharp rock
to create small holes. The shells are then strung together in intricate methods. Anciently, sennit or
purau (wild hibiscus fiber) was used to string the shells together. Today, modern nylon proves to be
more durable.
FARE POTE’E or FARE ARI’I: Chief’s Dwelling House
This chief’s dwelling represents the round-ended style of Tahitian architecture reserved usually for
Chiefs and Nobles. The larger this type of house is, the higher the rank of the owner. The important
furnishings would include many large finely woven mats, the noho ra’a or four-legged wooden seats
for high ranking individuals, the turu’a or wooden headrest, and an elevated bed.
There were 3 parts to a chiefly bed: first a layer of dried banana leaves, secondly a layer of mats piled
on top of one another for softness, and thirdly a coverlet or blanket which originally were made of
woven lauhala leaves. Today, quilts are favored because they are easier to maintain.
Other personal effects which might be found in a noble dwelling include costumes, small boxes of
highly valued red feathers, drums, flowers, and tiki carvings. Tikis are designed and placed to ward
off evil spirits. The largest tikis are usually located on the marae or temple enclosures.
57
The wives of the early Christian missionaries in Tahiti taught Tahitian women the art of quilting which
is called tifaifai. Tahitian quilting differs from the Hawaiian version in that they do not pad their quilts
with batting, nor do they sew the three layers together. Their quilts have only an applique or pieced-
together front which is backed with a complimentary backing.
The design of Tahitian quilts also differs from Hawaiian quilts in that Tahitians favor either large boldly-
colored overall designs which they applique, or piece together intricate patchwork designs using tiny
cutouts of colored cloth. On very special occasions of celebration, the treasured quilts they have
carefully stored are brought out and displayed for all to enjoy.
MARAE: Ancient Temple
Anciently, the Marae were built specifically for High Chiefs as a symbol of their power and authority.
Coronations & other important events such as war councils, peace treaties, victory celebrations and
voyage preparations, took place there. The Marae was usually a large rectangular area surrounded by
a stone wall, and guarded by tikis to discourage entries by the uninvited.
These human like figures carved in basalt, volcanic tuff, or wood are usually found near a marae or
other holy places. Experts believe tikis had religious significance and symbolized Gods and/or
deceased ancestors. Well preserved Tikis are found throughout Polynesia, particularly in the
Marquesas Islands, the largest being 9 feet tall.
A fear of evil or bad luck coming to individuals who disturb tikis may influence some natives. More
likely, the hope that tikis should be protected so future generations can view them, explains the
respect for tiki’s shown by most islanders.
Priest (Tahu’a)
The Priest or Tahu’a, was responsible for the clan’s sacred activities which include prayers, and other
ceremonies that are often accompanied in ancient times with animal or human sacrifices in order to
invoke favors from the Gods.
As an important member of the clan aristocracy, the Priest was assisted by lesser officiators called
“Haere”, who recited oral traditions, and helped enforce the many “rahui” or tapu (taboos).
58
The Marae was decreed sacred and available only to Priests and Chiefs. The Altar, built with several
layers of flat stones, is reserved as seating for the Priest and Royalty during ceremonies, and is
therefore considered to be the most holy place on the Marae.
Since the European era, once a year, the opening ceremony of the Heiva Nui i Tahiti, considered to be
one of the top-three worldwide Polynesian Cultural Events, takes place on the Marae Arahurahu,
located on the western side of the Island of Tahiti, with the re-enactment of various stages of a Chief’s
coronation ceremony. However, smaller Maraes were constructed by ancient Polynesian families or
clans, to celebrate other sacred traditions.
The Polynesian Cultural Center is proud to present our very own Tahitian Marae built by and under
the direction of Archeologist Mr. Joseph Tchong, (a native from Tahiti who has been actively engaged
in the renovation of other significant Maraes throughout French Poynesia), and approved by the
Minister of Cultures of French Polynesia who was officially represented by Mr. Heremoana
Maamaatuaiahutapu, Director of the House of Culture and the Office of Tourism, in the
groundbreaking and dedication of this marae for the common purpose of preserving & sharing with
the world, Tahiti’s ancient & sacred traditions, such as the celebration of births, marriages & deaths,
just to name a few.
This priceless work of art, gifted from “Te Fare Tauhiti Nui” and the “Association of Papenoo
Marae Preservation” to the Polynesian Cultural Center, was built with 3,200 river stones that have
been carefully handpicked one by one from the rivers deep in the beautiful valley of Papenoo Tahiti,
and shipped here to Hawaii, a process that took nearly a year.
FARE TUTU: Cooking Hut
This open structure is an example of a Tahitian cooking house. Each Tahitian family would have an
outdoor kitchen like this located where the smoke would not interfere with the main house. Both men
and women shared in the cooking chores. A man would typically gather the vegetables, hunt pigs and
birds, fish in the deeper waters, and perform the more strenuous cooking chores. Women’s
responsibilities include food preparation and assisting the men in making the underground oven.
The earth oven in Tahiti is called ahima’a which is prepared once a day around mid-morning. Several
volcanic rocks are first heated in a roaring fire. When the rocks are glowing and red hot, the firewood
debris is removed leaving the rocks for the actual cooking. A layer of banana stump fibers which have
been pounded into a stringy mass is placed immediately on the hot rocks.59
Next, the food to feed the family for a day is wrapped in a variety of leaves and placed on the banana
fiber layer. Vegetables like breadfruit, taro, umara, ufi and green bananas are scraped and peeled and
placed naturally on the rocks among the other food items.
The final layers consist of broad leaves, specially-woven mats made from the leaves of the wild hibiscus
tree, or green banana leaves, or old mats, used to seal in the heat until the food is cooked. Traditionally,
the dirt or sand dug from the pit is spaded on top of everything to ensure the best results.
NONI: Indian Mulberry Tree
The Indian Mulberry, or Noni, as it is called in Hawaii and Tahiti, grows well on sandy or rocky
shores. Apart from saline conditions, the plant also can withstand drought and grows in secondary
soils. Thus the noni tree can be seen in clearings, volcanic terrain, lava-strewn coasts and on limestone
outcrops.
USE AS FOOD: The fruits are edible, but have a strong pungent smell and taste, so for the
most part, they were eaten as a famine food. In some Pacific islands, like Raratonga &
Kiribati, the fruit was used as a staple food of choice, where they were cooked into curries and
stews. Elsewhere, the fruit is eaten raw with salt (Indochina, Australian Aborigines). The
fruits may also be fed to pig livestock. The young leaves can also be eaten as a vegetable and
contain protein (4-6%). Seeds may be roasted and eaten.
OTHER USES: The bark of the noni produces a reddish purple and brown dye. In Hawaii, a
yellowish dye was also extracted from the roots and also used to dye cloth. The tree was also
purposely planted to provide support for pepper vines and shade tree or wind-breaker for
coffee bushes.
TRADITIONAL MEDICINAL USES:
➢ Polynesians used various parts of the noni for medicinal purposes, such as containing
fever and as a tonic for upset stomach.
➢ Leaves, flowers, fruit and bark were used to treat eye problems, skin wounds and
abscesses.
➢ The leaves were soaked and placed on the gums and teeth for toothaches and chewed
to treat throat problems, respiratory ailments and constipation.
➢ Applying heated leaves to the chest was thought to help relieve coughs, nausea, colic,
and congestion of the chest.
➢ In some areas of the Philippines, juice of the leaves is taken for arthritis.
➢ Pounded unripe fruit is mixed with salt and applied to cuts and broken bones.
➢ Ripe fruit is used to draw out pus from an infected boil.
➢ Noni has become a plant of much interest in recent years, as modern scientists
researching its medicinal properties and possible health benefits. In a recent study by
the College of Tropical Agriculture at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, researchers
found evidence that some noni properties can help to control diseases like diabetes
and high blood pressure.`,
      history: 'The islands were settled by Polynesians around 1000 BCE (arriving around 830 AD in Tahiti specifically). European contact began with Captain Samuel Wallis (British) in 1767, followed by French Navigator Count Louis de Bougainville (1768) who called it an "earthly paradise." Spain also explored in 1521. France established a protectorate in 1842, and the islands became an overseas territory in 1946 after King Pomare V abdicated in 1880. French Polynesia gained self-governing rights in 1977. The region includes 116 islands across five groups: Society Islands (including Tahiti and Bora Bora), Marquesas, Austral, Tuamotus, and Gambier Islands.',
      culture: 'Tahitian and wider Ma\'ohi culture emphasizes \'aita pea pea (no worries), family, and connection to nature. Traditional arts include \'orero (oratory), tapa cloth making (called masi in darker colors with genealogical patterns), himene (polyphonic singing), and tattoo art which has seen major revival. The arioi were special traveling performers who sailed on double canoes performing dance, pantomime, and chants honoring the god Oro. Structures include fare tautai (fisherman\'s hut), fare heiva (celebration platform), fare pote\'e/fare ari\'i (chief\'s round-ended dwelling), and fare tutu (cooking hut). Tifaifai quilting was taught by missionaries.',
      traditions: 'Heiva festival celebrates Polynesian culture with dancing, singing, and sports annually. The \'ōte\'a is a rapid, rhythmic hip-shaking dance (tamure) performed by both men and women, often confused with Hawaiian hula. Skirts are made from fau (wild hibiscus fiber), not grass, and can weigh 7-8 pounds. Dancing is accompanied by to\'ere (wooden drums), fa\'atete (upright drums with goat/shark skin), pahu tupa\'i (hand drums), and tari parau (stick drums). The ahima\'a (underground oven) is prepared mid-morning. Marae (stone temple platforms) were guarded by tiki carvings and used for coronations, war councils, and ceremonies for chiefs.',
      language: 'Tahitian (Reo Tahiti) is the main Polynesian language, with French as the official language. Common phrases: Ia ora na (hello), Māuruuru (thank you), Nana (goodbye). The language shares roots with Hawaiian and Māori, showing ancient Polynesian connections. Tahiti is famous for producing vanilla (among the finest in the world), black pearls (poe rava) farmed in Tuamotu lagoons, monoi (coconut oil used as lotion), and noni fruit (used medicinally by Polynesians for fever, infections, and various ailments).'

      history: 'Archaeological evidence indicates discovery by Polynesians around 400 AD, led according to legend by Chief Hotu Matu\'a from what is now French Polynesia. Dutch Admiral Jacob Roggeveen came upon Rapa Nui on Easter Sunday 1722, hence the English name. In 1852 Chile annexed the island, where it remains a territory today. The island once supported a population as large as 10,000, but European diseases and indentured labor decimated it to only 111 people in the early 1900s. Today about 3,000 people live there. The island was once covered with trees, all cut down possibly to aid in constructing and transporting the almost 900 moai.',
      culture: 'Rapa Nui forms the eastern apex of the Polynesian Triangle. It\'s a small volcanic island of 67 square miles, rising to 1,700 feet at its highest point. The culture is famous for moai (stone statues) carved from scoria (hardened volcanic ash) at the Rano Raraku quarry. Statues range from a few feet to almost 80 feet tall. Each moai on an ahu (burial platform) represents an Ariki (king) or Tagata Honui (chief) buried beneath it. The pukao (red scoria topknot) represents hair that men bundled on top of their heads. Eyes (mata) are carved from white coral with red scoria pupils - when placed, the moai "could see" and came alive.',
      traditions: 'The Birdman (Tangata Manu) competition determined yearly leadership. Competitors scaled vertical cliffs of Rano Kau crater, swam through shark-infested waters to small islets, and brought back an unbroken sooty tern egg. The winner received special honors and privileges. Over 480 Birdman petroglyphs are carved into basalt at the ceremonial village of Orongo, possibly representing competition winners. Structures include hare vaka (boat houses shaped like overturned canoes, 30-60 feet long), hare ma\'ea (stone houses for ceremonies), and mana vai (rock-walled garden pits protecting plants from strong winds). Staple foods included taro, banana, sugar cane, and sweet potato.',
      language: 'Rapa Nui may have been the only Polynesians with a writing system: rongorongo tablets. Unfortunately, the ability to translate them was lost forever as the population was decimated. The greeting is "Io rana!" The island possesses unique petroglyphs (rock carvings), traditional wood carvings, tapa crafts, tattooing, string figures, dance and music. In 2003, four Rapa Nui master carvers came to Hawaii and created seven authentic moai for the Polynesian Cultural Center, naming the platform Ahu Tu\'u Koihu after the first chief who started the statue-building tradition. The largest moai still in the quarry measures approximately 70 feet tall.'

// Polynesian Migration Information
export const migrationInfo = {
  title: 'Polynesian Migrations & Voyaging',
  sections: {
    overview: 'In 1000 A.D. (492 years before Columbus), Polynesian explorers were settling the Marquesas and Hawaii. Spread over nearly 16 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean, Polynesia covers more area than any nation in the world. By 1380 A.D., Polynesian voyagers managed to travel to and colonize over 1,000 islands, from Hawaii in the north, New Zealand (Aotearoa) in the south, and Easter Island (Rapa Nui) in the east.',
    navigation: 'Polynesians were the most successful navigators in world maritime history. They used winds, clouds, stars, ocean swells, birds, and reflected wave patterns to navigate without written language or modern instruments. They could travel 160 miles per day in voyaging canoes 150-200 feet long and 35 feet wide, reaching speeds of 15 miles per hour. A voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti took only 20-35 days, while European ships took 60 days.',
    origins: 'There is debate about where Polynesians came from. Evidence suggests migration from Southeast Asia (taro, breadfruit, bananas, pigs, chickens, dogs, and Lapita pottery all originated there). However, evidence also points to South America: the sweet potato (called kumara in many Polynesian languages, matching the Quechua Indian word), Maori saying their people came from Peru, papaya, American cotton breeds, similar Tiki carvings, and predominately O-positive blood type matching American Indians rather than Asian A and B types.',
    skills: 'Polynesian navigators trained from childhood, memorizing thousands of stars for any season. They used star compasses marking rising and setting points of distinctive stars. They maintained course by keeping ocean swells at consistent angles against the canoe. Signs of land included: reflected wave patterns near landmasses, land-based birds (traveling only 40 miles from nests), cumulus clouds (forming only above land), and cloud color reflections (green/gray for land, red for volcanic activity).',
    modernVoyaging: 'Today, Hawaii has three voyaging canoes training new navigators in traditional skills. The famous Hokule\'a uses only traditional navigation methods. On one voyage, their position was only 10 miles off from the space shuttle\'s sophisticated computer equipment. The Iosepa, a 57-foot wa\'a kaulua (twin-hulled voyaging canoe) was built at BYU-Hawaii in 2001 by master carvers Sione Tuione Pulotu (Tongan) and Kawika Eskaran (Hawaiian) from eight dakua logs imported from Fiji.'
